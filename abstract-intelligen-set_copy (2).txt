Abstract: Artificial intelligence has been advancing in fields including anesthesiology. 
This scoping review of the intersection of artificial intelligence and 
anesthesia research identified and summarized six themes of applications of 
artificial intelligence in anesthesiology: (1) depth of anesthesia monitoring, 
(2) control of anesthesia, (3) event and risk prediction, (4) ultrasound 
guidance, (5) pain management, and (6) operating room logistics. Based on papers 
identified in the review, several topics within artificial intelligence were 
described and summarized: (1) machine learning (including supervised, 
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), (2) techniques in artificial 
intelligence (e.g., classical machine learning, neural networks and deep 
learning, Bayesian methods), and (3) major applied fields in artificial 
intelligence.The implications of artificial intelligence for the practicing 
anesthesiologist are discussed as are its limitations and the role of clinicians 
in further developing artificial intelligence for use in clinical care. 
Artificial intelligence has the potential to impact the practice of 
anesthesiology in aspects ranging from perioperative support to critical care 
delivery to outpatient pain management.

Abstract: Intelligence - the ability to learn, reason and solve problems - is at the 
forefront of behavioural genetic research. Intelligence is highly heritable and 
predicts important educational, occupational and health outcomes better than any 
other trait. Recent genome-wide association studies have successfully identified 
inherited genome sequence differences that account for 20% of the 50% 
heritability of intelligence. These findings open new avenues for research into 
the causes and consequences of intelligence using genome-wide polygenic scores 
that aggregate the effects of thousands of genetic variants.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and making its way into all areas 
of our lives. This review discusses developments and potential practices 
regarding the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and 
the related topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence 
applications related to the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, 
journals, search engines, print and social media. Resources were cross-checked 
to verify the information. Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which 
were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the 
field of ophthalmology, especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being 
conducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the 
field of ophthalmology, especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular 
degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come 
to the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies 
shows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for 
future work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be 
effective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing 
them to physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer 
trained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider 
the possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be 
candidates for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions 
about moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. 
Although it is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have 
moral/ethical status, it has yet to be determined what the exact the 
characteristics that confer moral/ethical status are or will be.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine has made dramatic progress in recent years. 
However, much of this progress is seemingly scattered, lacking a cohesive 
structure for the discerning observer. In this article, we will provide an 
up-to-date review of artificial intelligence in medicine, with a specific focus 
on its application to radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology. We 
will discuss a range of selected papers that illustrate the potential uses of 
artificial intelligence in a technologically advanced future.

Abstract: The medical profession deals with 'humanism' which involves interactions with 
people, the ability to think about them, care for them, and to provide positive 
reinforcement in clinical follow-ups. Emotional intelligence integrates the 
significant features of personal relationships to promote self-management 
skills, like adaptability, control of temperaments and reduction of tension, 
which can improve performance of individuals. This has led to increasing 
interest in the importance of emotional intelligence for effective academic 
growth, professional experiences and clinical practice. There are many studies 
examining the correlation between emotional intelligence and academic 
achievement at different education levels, signifying its importance to predict 
students who need guided intervention. With proven relationship between 
emotional intelligence and academic success, the assessment of emotional 
intelligence can be introduced in entrance exams of medical schools to recognise 
students who might need directed intermediation. With the agreement of all 
stakeholders, emotional intelligence training workshops and awareness sessions 
can be introduced for educators and students.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields 
of medicine, assisting physicians in most steps of patient management. In 
nephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical 
care, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. 
However, many nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of 
medical artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of 
medical artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all 
fields of nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and 
machine learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and 
deep learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of 
artificial intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe 
how artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive 
immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial 
intelligence in clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and 
conclude with a discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial 
intelligence raises in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient 
relationship, patient privacy, and data collection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, which has been actively applied in a broad range of 
industries in recent years, is an active area of interest for many researchers. 
Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial 
intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial 
(OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology 
have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image 
classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and 
refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed 
for the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, 
and image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve 
good results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making 
accurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to 
widely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, 
there are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of 
fine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial 
intelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If 
solutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial 
intelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is 
expected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis 
systems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment 
tools. OMF radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the 
characteristics of radiographic images, will play a very important role in the 
development of artificial intelligence applications in this field.

Title: Mandevillian intelligence.

Authors: Smart PR(1).

AuthorInformation: (1)Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Highfield,

Abstract: Mandevillian intelligence is a specific form of collective intelligence in which 
individual cognitive vices (i.e., shortcomings, limitations, constraints and 
biases) are seen to play a positive functional role in yielding collective forms 
of cognitive success. The present paper introduces the concept of mandevillian 
intelligence and reviews a number of strands of empirical research that help to 
shed light on the phenomenon. The paper also attempts to highlight the value of 
the concept of mandevillian intelligence from a philosophical, scientific and 
engineering perspective. Inasmuch as we accept the notion of mandevillian 
intelligence, then it seems that the cognitive and epistemic value of a specific 
social or technological intervention will vary according to whether our 
attention is focused at the individual or collective level of analysis. This has 
a number of important implications for how we think about the design and 
evaluation of collective cognitive systems. For example, the notion of 
mandevillian intelligence forces us to take seriously the idea that the 
exploitation (or even the accentuation) of individual cognitive shortcomings 
could, in some situations, provide a productive route to collective forms of 
cognitive and epistemic success.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Over recent years there has been criticism within the United 
Kingdom's health service regarding a lack of care and compassion, resulting in 
adverse outcomes for patients. The impact of emotional intelligence in staff on 
patient health care outcomes has been recently highlighted. Many recruiters now 
assess emotional intelligence as part of their selection process for health care 
staff. However, it has been argued that the importance of emotional intelligence 
in health care has been overestimated.
OBJECTIVES: To explore relationships between emotional intelligence in health 
care professionals, and caring behaviour. To further explore any additional 
factors related to emotional intelligence that may impact upon caring behaviour.
DESIGN: An integrative review design was used.
DATA SOURCES: Psychinfo, Medline, CINAHL Plus, Social Sciences Citation Index, 
Science Citation Index, and Scopus were searched for studies from 1995 to April 
2017.
REVIEW METHODS: Studies providing quantitative or qualitative exploration of how 
any healthcare professionals' emotional intelligence is linked to caring in 
healthcare settings were selected.
RESULTS: Twenty two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Three main types 
of health care professional were identified: nurses, nurse leaders, and 
physicians. Results indicated that the emotional intelligence of nurses was 
related to both physical and emotional caring, but emotional intelligence may be 
less relevant for nurse leaders and physicians. Age, experience, burnout, and 
job satisfaction may also be relevant factors for both caring and emotional 
intelligence.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that developing emotional 
intelligence in nurses may positively impact upon certain caring behaviours, and 
that there may be differences within groups that warrant further investigation. 
Understanding more about which aspects of emotional intelligence are most 
relevant for intervention is important, and directions for further large scale 
research have been identified.

Abstract: Despite intelligence research being among the most replicable bodies of 
empirical findings-a Rosetta stone across the social sciences-the communication 
of intelligence research with non-intelligence researchers and the public 
remains a challenge, especially given ongoing public controversies throughout 
the history of the field. Hunt argued that "we have a communication problem." 
This article is a call for intelligence researchers to consider communication at 
multiple levels-communication with other intelligence researchers, communication 
with non-intelligence researchers, and communication with the public, defined 
here as policymakers, practitioners, students, and general readers. It discusses 
ongoing tensions between academic freedom and social responsibility and provides 
suggestions for thinking about communication and effective research translation 
and implementation of intelligence research from the frameworks of science and 
policy research communication. It concludes with some recommendations for 
effective communication and stresses the importance of incentivizing more 
scholars to responsibly seek to educate and engage with multiple publics about 
the science of intelligence.
