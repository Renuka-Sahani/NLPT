    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence has been advancing in fields including anesthesiology. \nThis scoping review of the intersection of artificial intelligence and \nanesthesia research identified and summarized six themes of applications of \nartificial intelligence in anesthesiology: (1) depth of anesthesia monitoring, \n(2) control of anesthesia, (3) event and risk prediction, (4) ultrasound \nguidance, (5) pain management, and (6) operating room logistics. Based on papers \nidentified in the review, several topics within artificial intelligence were \ndescribed and summarized: (1) machine learning (including supervised, \nunsupervised, and reinforcement learning), (2) techniques in artificial \nintelligence (e.g., classical machine learning, neural networks and deep \nlearning, Bayesian methods), and (3) major applied fields in artificial \nintelligence.The implications of artificial intelligence for the practicing \nanesthesiologist are discussed as are its limitations and the role of clinicians \nin further developing artificial intelligence for use in clinical care. \nArtificial intelligence has the potential to impact the practice of \nanesthesiology in aspects ranging from perioperative support to critical care \ndelivery to outpatient pain management.",

    "Abstract": "Intelligence - the ability to learn, reason and solve problems - is at the \nforefront of behavioural genetic research. Intelligence is highly heritable and \npredicts important educational, occupational and health outcomes better than any \nother trait. Recent genome-wide association studies have successfully identified \ninherited genome sequence differences that account for 20% of the 50% \nheritability of intelligence. These findings open new avenues for research into \nthe causes and consequences of intelligence using genome-wide polygenic scores \nthat aggregate the effects of thousands of genetic variants.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and making its way into all areas \nof our lives. This review discusses developments and potential practices \nregarding the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and \nthe related topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence \napplications related to the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, \njournals, search engines, print and social media. Resources were cross-checked \nto verify the information. Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which \nwere approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the \nfield of ophthalmology, especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being \nconducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the \nfield of ophthalmology, especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular \ndegeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come \nto the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies \nshows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for \nfuture work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be \neffective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing \nthem to physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer \ntrained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider \nthe possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be \ncandidates for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions \nabout moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. \nAlthough it is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have \nmoral/ethical status, it has yet to be determined what the exact the \ncharacteristics that confer moral/ethical status are or will be.",

    "Abstract": "The medical profession deals with 'humanism' which involves interactions with \npeople, the ability to think about them, care for them, and to provide positive \nreinforcement in clinical follow-ups. Emotional intelligence integrates the \nsignificant features of personal relationships to promote self-management \nskills, like adaptability, control of temperaments and reduction of tension, \nwhich can improve performance of individuals. This has led to increasing \ninterest in the importance of emotional intelligence for effective academic \ngrowth, professional experiences and clinical practice. There are many studies \nexamining the correlation between emotional intelligence and academic \nachievement at different education levels, signifying its importance to predict \nstudents who need guided intervention. With proven relationship between \nemotional intelligence and academic success, the assessment of emotional \nintelligence can be introduced in entrance exams of medical schools to recognise \nstudents who might need directed intermediation. With the agreement of all \nstakeholders, emotional intelligence training workshops and awareness sessions \ncan be introduced for educators and students.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields \nof medicine, assisting physicians in most steps of patient management. In \nnephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical \ncare, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. \nHowever, many nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of \nmedical artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of \nmedical artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all \nfields of nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and \nmachine learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and \ndeep learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of \nartificial intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe \nhow artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive \nimmunoglobulin A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial \nintelligence in clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and \nconclude with a discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial \nintelligence raises in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient \nrelationship, patient privacy, and data collection.\n\nCopyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence, which has been actively applied in a broad range of \nindustries in recent years, is an active area of interest for many researchers. \nDentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial \nintelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial \n(OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology \nhave mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image \nclassification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and \nrefinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed \nfor the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, \nand image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve \ngood results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making \naccurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to \nwidely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, \nthere are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of \nfine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial \nintelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If \nsolutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial \nintelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is \nexpected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis \nsystems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment \ntools. OMF radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the \ncharacteristics of radiographic images, will play a very important role in the \ndevelopment of artificial intelligence applications in this field.",

    "Abstract": "Mandevillian intelligence is a specific form of collective intelligence in which \nindividual cognitive vices (i.e., shortcomings, limitations, constraints and \nbiases) are seen to play a positive functional role in yielding collective forms \nof cognitive success. The present paper introduces the concept of mandevillian \nintelligence and reviews a number of strands of empirical research that help to \nshed light on the phenomenon. The paper also attempts to highlight the value of \nthe concept of mandevillian intelligence from a philosophical, scientific and \nengineering perspective. Inasmuch as we accept the notion of mandevillian \nintelligence, then it seems that the cognitive and epistemic value of a specific \nsocial or technological intervention will vary according to whether our \nattention is focused at the individual or collective level of analysis. This has \na number of important implications for how we think about the design and \nevaluation of collective cognitive systems. For example, the notion of \nmandevillian intelligence forces us to take seriously the idea that the \nexploitation (or even the accentuation) of individual cognitive shortcomings \ncould, in some situations, provide a productive route to collective forms of \ncognitive and epistemic success.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over recent years there has been criticism within the United \nKingdom's health service regarding a lack of care and compassion, resulting in \nadverse outcomes for patients. The impact of emotional intelligence in staff on \npatient health care outcomes has been recently highlighted. Many recruiters now \nassess emotional intelligence as part of their selection process for health care \nstaff. However, it has been argued that the importance of emotional intelligence \nin health care has been overestimated.\nOBJECTIVES: To explore relationships between emotional intelligence in health \ncare professionals, and caring behaviour. To further explore any additional \nfactors related to emotional intelligence that may impact upon caring behaviour.\nDESIGN: An integrative review design was used.\nDATA SOURCES: Psychinfo, Medline, CINAHL Plus, Social Sciences Citation Index, \nScience Citation Index, and Scopus were searched for studies from 1995 to April \n2017.\nREVIEW METHODS: Studies providing quantitative or qualitative exploration of how \nany healthcare professionals' emotional intelligence is linked to caring in \nhealthcare settings were selected.\nRESULTS: Twenty two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Three main types \nof health care professional were identified: nurses, nurse leaders, and \nphysicians. Results indicated that the emotional intelligence of nurses was \nrelated to both physical and emotional caring, but emotional intelligence may be \nless relevant for nurse leaders and physicians. Age, experience, burnout, and \njob satisfaction may also be relevant factors for both caring and emotional \nintelligence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that developing emotional \nintelligence in nurses may positively impact upon certain caring behaviours, and \nthat there may be differences within groups that warrant further investigation. \nUnderstanding more about which aspects of emotional intelligence are most \nrelevant for intervention is important, and directions for further large scale \nresearch have been identified.\n\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
