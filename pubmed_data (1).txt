Title: The relation between intelligence and religiosity: a meta-analysis and some proposed explanations.
Year: 2013
Authors: Zuckerman Miron, Silberman Jordan, Hall Judith A
Abstract: A meta-analysis of 63 studies showed a significant negative association between intelligence and religiosity. The association was stronger for college students and the general population than for participants younger than college age; it was also stronger for religious beliefs than religious behavior. For college students and the general population, means of weighted and unweighted correlations between intelligence and the strength of religious beliefs ranged from -.20 to -.25 (mean r = -.24). Three possible interpretations were discussed. First, intelligent people are less likely to conform and, thus, are more likely to resist religious dogma. Second, intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic (as opposed to intuitive) thinking style, which has been shown to undermine religious beliefs. Third, several functions of religiosity, including compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence. Intelligent people may therefore have less need for religious beliefs and practices.

Title: Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence.
Year: 2017
Authors: Hassabis Demis, Kumaran Dharshan, Summerfield Christopher, Botvinick Matthew
Abstract: The fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long and intertwined history. In more recent times, however, communication and collaboration between the two fields has become less commonplace. In this article, we argue that better understanding biological brains could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We survey historical interactions between the AI and neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI that have been inspired by the study of neural computation in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting shared themes that may be key for advancing future research in both fields.

Title: Role of emotional intelligence in effective nurse leadership.
Year: 2021
Authors: Lambert Steve
Abstract: Emotionally intelligent leaders demonstrate a sensitivity to their own and other people's psychological health and well-being, directing others towards common goals while developing effective personal relationships with their colleagues and team members. Emotional intelligence is particularly relevant in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, where nurse leaders need to demonstrate this skill when supporting their teams to manage high levels of stress, exhaustion and the risk of moral injury. This article explores emotional intelligence, discusses its importance as a characteristic of effective nurse leaders and managers, and suggests practical activities that leaders can undertake to develop their emotional intelligence skills.

Title: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Assisted Biomedical Systems for Intelligent Healthcare.
Year: 2022
Authors: Manickam Pandiaraj, Mariappan Siva Ananth, Murugesan Sindhu Monica, Hansda Shekhar, Kaushik Ajeet, Shinde Ravikumar, Thipperudraswamy S P
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and functionalities that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such intelligent systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging, and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical devices with a software application for advancing human health. In this review, we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in this article. The position and importance of AI in improving the functionality, detection accuracy, decision-making ability of IoMT devices, and evaluation of associated risks assessment is discussed carefully and critically in this review. This review also encompasses the technological and engineering challenges and prospects for AI-based cloud-integrated personalized IoMT devices for designing efficient POC biomedical systems suitable for next-generation intelligent healthcare.

Title: The Co-Existence of Technology and Caring in the Theory of Technological Competency as Caring in Nursing.
Year: 2017
Authors: Locsin Rozzano C
Abstract: The coexistence of technology and caring is best exemplified in nursing. The theory of Technological Competency as Caring in Nursing illuminates this coexistence as the essence of technology in health care premised on machine technologies as a generic concept of objects or things that are mechanical, organic, and electronic. With its timely development these technologies are continually imbued with artificial general intelligence. As such, the ultimate expression of machine technologies in nursing turns out to be autonomous robots (ARs) with future potentials of functions comparable to human persons. While theory-based nursing practice is essential to nursing care practice, quality human care, particularly with technologies assuming indispensable practice process mechanisms is critical. Some practice-based questions informing ARs and human person engagements in nursing care practice include, "Will ARs which are imbued with artificial intelligence replace nurses in their practice?" "What contributions to quality human health care will autonomous and artificially intelligent robots provide?" While these questions may reflect far-reaching ramifications of technologies in health care, it must also be acknowledged that these technologies are fundamental to the delivery of quality human health care now, and in the future.

Title: World model learning and inference.
Year: 2021
Authors: Friston Karl, Moran Rosalyn J, Nagai Yukie, Taniguchi Tadahiro, Gomi Hiroaki, Tenenbaum Josh
Abstract: Understanding information processing in the brain-and creating general-purpose artificial intelligence-are long-standing aspirations of scientists and engineers worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world.

Title: Lead (Pb) neurotoxicology and cognition.
Year: 2019
Authors: Santa Maria Michael P, Hill Benjamin D, Kline Joshua
Abstract: Lead (Pb) is a neurotoxic substance. While it is widely understood that Pb exposure in early childhood adversely impacts neurodevelopment and intelligence, other aspects of cognition that are negatively affected, and the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology underlying Pb-related cognitive impairment are not widely appreciated by clinicians. This critical review gives a broad synopsis of the current literature in the field. The means by which Pb enters the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier, alters brain structure and function, and consequently impacts measurable aspects of cognition are reviewed. We detail research relating exposure to Pb at various levels in early childhood to deficits in IQ, academic achievement, executive functioning, and cognition in general. Clinical disorders associated with early Pb exposure, common and uncommon routes of environmental exposure, and potential confounding variables are discussed. We discuss methods of statistically accounting for these issues in the context of potential means of relying upon existing research and specific individuals' known blood Pb levels to make reasonable calculations regarding Pb-related compromise of intellectual functioning for individuals in clinical settings.

Title: Intelligence and childlessness.
Year: 2014
Authors: Kanazawa Satoshi
Abstract: Demographers debate why people have children in advanced industrial societies where children are net economic costs. From an evolutionary perspective, however, the important question is why some individuals choose not to have children. Recent theoretical developments in evolutionary psychology suggest that more intelligent individuals may be more likely to prefer to remain childless than less intelligent individuals. Analyses of the National Child Development Study show that more intelligent men and women express preference to remain childless early in their reproductive careers, but only more intelligent women (not more intelligent men) are more likely to remain childless by the end of their reproductive careers. Controlling for education and earnings does not at all attenuate the association between childhood general intelligence and lifetime childlessness among women. One-standard-deviation increase in childhood general intelligence (15 IQ points) decreases women's odds of parenthood by 21-25%. Because women have a greater impact on the average intelligence of future generations, the dysgenic fertility among women is predicted to lead to a decline in the average intelligence of the population in advanced industrial nations.

Title: Application of Intelligent Medical Sensing Technology.
Year: 2023
Authors: Fu Jie, Gao Qiya, Li Shuang
Abstract: With the popularization of intelligent sensing and the improvement of modern medical technology, intelligent medical sensing technology has emerged as the times require. This technology combines basic disciplines such as physics, mathematics, and materials with modern technologies such as semiconductors, integrated circuits, and artificial intelligence, and has become one of the most promising in the medical field. The core of intelligent medical sensor technology is to make existing medical sensors intelligent, portable, and wearable with full consideration of ergonomics and sensor power consumption issues in order to conform to the current trends in cloud medicine, personalized medicine, and health monitoring. With the development of automation and intelligence in measurement and control systems, it is required that sensors have high accuracy, reliability, and stability, as well as certain data processing capabilities, self-checking, self-calibration, and self-compensation, while traditional medical sensors cannot meet such requirements. In addition, to manufacture high-performance sensors, it is also difficult to improve the material process alone, and it is necessary to combine computer technology with sensor technology to make up for its performance shortcomings. Intelligent medical sensing technology combines medical sensors with microprocessors to produce powerful intelligent medical sensors. Based on the original sensor functions, intelligent medical sensors also have functions such as self-compensation, self-calibration, self-diagnosis, numerical processing, two-way communication, information storage, and digital output. This review focuses on the application of intelligent medical sensing technology in biomedical sensing detection from three aspects: physical sensor, chemical sensor, and biosensor.

Title: Synthetic collective intelligence.
Year: 2016
Authors: Solé Ricard, Amor Daniel R, Duran-Nebreda Salva, Conde-Pueyo Núria, Carbonell-Ballestero Max, Montañez Raúl
Abstract: Intelligent systems have emerged in our biosphere in different contexts and achieving different levels of complexity. The requirement of communication in a social context has been in all cases a determinant. The human brain, probably co-evolving with language, is an exceedingly successful example. Similarly, social insects complex collective decisions emerge from information exchanges between many agents. The difference is that such processing is obtained out of a limited individual cognitive power. Computational models and embodied versions using non-living systems, particularly involving robot swarms, have been used to explore the potentiality of collective intelligence. Here we suggest a novel approach to the problem grounded in the genetic engineering of unicellular systems, which can be modified in order to interact, store memories or adapt to external stimuli in collective ways. What we label as Synthetic Swarm Intelligence defines a parallel approach to the evolution of computation and swarm intelligence and allows to explore potential embodied scenarios for decision making at the microscale. Here, we consider several relevant examples of collective intelligence and their synthetic organism counterparts.

Title: Linking brain network reconfiguration and intelligence: Are we there yet?
Year: 2019
Authors: Girn Manesh, Mills Caitlin, Christoff Kalina
Abstract: Recent applications of dynamic network analyses to functional neuroimaging data have revealed relationships between a number of cognition conditions and the dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks. Here we critically review such applications of network neuroscience to intelligence. After providing an overview of network neuroscience, we center our discussion around the recently proposed Network Neuroscience Theory of Intelligence (Barbey, 2017). We evaluate and review existing empirical support for the theses made by this theory and argue that while studies strongly suggest their plausibility, evidence to date has largely been indirect. We propose avenues for future research to directly evaluate these theses by overcoming the methodological and analytical shortcomings of previous studies. In doing so, our goal is to stimulate future empirical investigations and present valuable ways forward in the network neuroscience of intelligence.

Title: Artificial and human intelligence for early identification of neonatal sepsis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Sullivan Brynne A, Kausch Sherry L, Fairchild Karen D
Abstract: Artificial intelligence may have a role in the early detection of sepsis in neonates. Machine learning can identify patterns that predict high or increasing risk for clinical deterioration from a sepsis-like illness. In developing this potential addition to NICU care, careful consideration should be given to the data and methods used to develop, validate, and evaluate prediction models. When an AI system alerts clinicians to a change in a patient's condition that warrants a bedside evaluation, human intelligence and experience come into play to determine an appropriate course of action: evaluate and treat or wait and watch closely. With intelligently developed, validated, and implemented AI sepsis systems, both clinicians and patients stand to benefit. IMPACT: This narrative review highlights the application of AI in neonatal sepsis prediction. It describes issues in clinical prediction model development specific to this population. This article reviews the methods, considerations, and literature on neonatal sepsis model development and validation. Challenges of AI technology and potential barriers to using sepsis AI systems in the NICU are discussed.

Title: Beyond collective intelligence: Collective adaptation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Galesic Mirta, Barkoczi Daniel, Berdahl Andrew M, Biro Dora, Carbone Giuseppe, Giannoccaro Ilaria, Goldstone Robert L, Gonzalez Cleotilde, Kandler Anne, Kao Albert B, Kendal Rachel, Kline Michelle, Lee Eun, Massari Giovanni Francesco, Mesoudi Alex, Olsson Henrik, Pescetelli Niccolo, Sloman Sabina J, Smaldino Paul E, Stein Daniel L
Abstract: We develop a conceptual framework for studying collective adaptation in complex socio-cognitive systems, driven by dynamic interactions of social integration strategies, social environments and problem structures. Going beyond searching for 'intelligent' collectives, we integrate research from different disciplines and outline modelling approaches that can be used to begin answering questions such as why collectives sometimes fail to reach seemingly obvious solutions, how they change their strategies and network structures in response to different problems and how we can anticipate and perhaps change future harmful societal trajectories. We discuss the importance of considering path dependence, lack of optimization and collective myopia to understand the sometimes counterintuitive outcomes of collective adaptation. We call for a transdisciplinary, quantitative and societally useful social science that can help us to understand our rapidly changing and ever more complex societies, avoid collective disasters and reach the full potential of our ability to organize in adaptive collectives.

Title: Is cancer an intelligent species?
Year: 2023
Authors: Nicolazzo Chiara, Francescangeli Federica, Magri Valentina, Giuliani Alessandro, Zeuner Ann, Gazzaniga Paola
Abstract: Some relevant emerging properties of intelligent systems are "adaptation to a changing environment," "reaction to unexpected situations," "capacity of problem solving," and "ability to communicate." Single cells have remarkable abilities to adapt, make adequate context-dependent decision, take constructive actions, and communicate, thus theoretically meeting all the above-mentioned requirements. From a biological point of view, cancer can be viewed as an invasive species, composed of cells that move from primary to distant sites, being continuously exposed to changes in the environmental conditions. Blood represents the first hostile habitat that a cancer cell encounters once detached from the primary site, so that cancer cells must rapidly carry out multiple adaptation strategies to survive. The aim of this review was to deepen the adaptation mechanisms of cancer cells in the blood microenvironment, particularly referring to four adaptation strategies typical of animal species (phenotypic adaptation, metabolic adaptation, niche adaptation, and collective adaptation), which together define the broad concept of biological intelligence. We provided evidence that the required adaptations (either structural, metabolic, and related to metastatic niche formation) and "social" behavior are useful principles allowing putting into a coherent frame many features of circulating cancer cells. This interpretative frame is described by the comparison with analog behavioral traits typical of various animal models.

Title: Foreign Accented-Speech and Perceptions of Confidence and Intelligence.
Year: 2023
Authors: Abu Guba Mohammed Nour, Daoud Sumaya, Jarbou Samer
Abstract: The purpose of the current study is to explore listeners' perception of accented speech in terms of confidence and intelligence. To this end, three groups of listeners were asked to rate speakers of English with various accent strengths based on a 9-point scale in terms of accent magnitude, confidence and intelligence. Results show that the two Jordanian listener groups, unlike the English listeners, reacted similarly toward Jordanian-accented speakers of English. Overall, the three groups tended to link accentedness with perceptions of confidence and intelligence. The findings of this study have significant implications for advocating a tolerant attitude toward speakers of English as a foreign language in the fields of education, employment opportunities, and social justice. It is suggested that stereotyping speakers as inferior in terms of qualities such as confidence and intelligence reflects established listener's bias rather than lack of speaker's intelligibility.

Title: Machiavellian intelligence retrospective.
Year: 2018
Authors: Byrne Richard W
Abstract: Thirty years on from the publication of Machiavellian Intelligence (Byrne & Whiten, 1988), it is time to consider how the ideas in it have influenced understanding of the evolution of intelligence, how they have been tested (and sometimes misunderstood), and whether they are still relevant today. This essay attempts to do so. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).

Title: Neuronal factors determining high intelligence.
Year: 2016
Authors: Dicke Ursula, Roth Gerhard
Abstract: Many attempts have been made to correlate degrees of both animal and human intelligence with brain properties. With respect to mammals, a much-discussed trait concerns absolute and relative brain size, either uncorrected or corrected for body size. However, the correlation of both with degrees of intelligence yields large inconsistencies, because although they are regarded as the most intelligent mammals, monkeys and apes, including humans, have neither the absolutely nor the relatively largest brains. The best fit between brain traits and degrees of intelligence among mammals is reached by a combination of the number of cortical neurons, neuron packing density, interneuronal distance and axonal conduction velocity--factors that determine general information processing capacity (IPC), as reflected by general intelligence. The highest IPC is found in humans, followed by the great apes, Old World and New World monkeys. The IPC of cetaceans and elephants is much lower because of a thin cortex, low neuron packing density and low axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, corvid and psittacid birds have very small and densely packed pallial neurons and relatively many neurons, which, despite very small brain volumes, might explain their high intelligence. The evolution of a syntactical and grammatical language in humans most probably has served as an additional intelligence amplifier, which may have happened in songbirds and psittacids in a convergent manner.

Abstract: The application of wearable devices is promoting the development toward digitization and intelligence in the field of health. However, the current smart devices centered on human health have disadvantages such as weak perception, high interference degree, and unfriendly interaction. Here, an intelligent health agent based on multifunctional fibers, with the characteristics of autonomy, activeness, intelligence, and perceptibility enabling health services, is proposed. According to the requirements for healthcare in the medical field and daily life, four major aspects driven by intelligent agents, including health monitoring, therapy, protection, and minimally invasive surgery, are summarized from the perspectives of materials science, medicine, and computer science. The function of intelligent health agents is realized through multifunctional fibers as sensing units and artificial intelligence technology as a cognitive engine. The structure, characteristics, and performance of fibers and analysis systems and algorithms are reviewed, while discussing future challenges and opportunities in healthcare and medicine. Finally, based on the above four aspects, future scenarios related to health protection of a person's life are presented. Intelligent health agents will have the potential to accelerate the realization of precision medicine and active health.

Title: Network Neuroscience Theory of Human Intelligence.
Year: 2018
Authors: Barbey Aron K
Abstract: An enduring aim of research in the psychological and brain sciences is to understand the nature of individual differences in human intelligence, examining the stunning breadth and diversity of intellectual abilities and the remarkable neurobiological mechanisms from which they arise. This Opinion article surveys recent neuroscience evidence to elucidate how general intelligence, g, emerges from individual differences in the network architecture of the human brain. The reviewed findings motivate new insights about how network topology and dynamics account for individual differences in g, represented by the Network Neuroscience Theory. According to this framework, g emerges from the small-world topology of brain networks and the dynamic reorganization of its community structure in the service of system-wide flexibility and adaptation.

Title: Social Intelligence and Psychological Distress: Subjective and Psychological Well-Being as Mediators.
Year: 2020
Authors: Azañedo Carolina M, Sastre Santiago, Artola Teresa, Alvarado Jesús M, Jiménez-Blanco Amelia
Abstract: The strength named "social intelligence" in the Values in Action (VIA) Classification of Character Strengths and Virtues represents emotional, personal, and social intelligences, which are considered "hot intelligences". This work contributed to the study of the mechanisms of influence of social intelligence on mental health. A multiple mediation model was proposed to quantify the direct effect of social intelligence on psychopathological symptoms, as well as its indirect effect through its impact on components of subjective and psychological well-being. This study involved 1407 university students who completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWBS), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Social intelligence was found to be significantly associated with life satisfaction (<i>a</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> < 0.001), positive affect (<i>a</i> = 0.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and negative affect (<i>a</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> < 0.001), transmitting significant indirect effects on psychopathological symptomatology through these components of subjective well-being. Likewise, social intelligence was positively and significantly related to psychological well-being (<i>a</i>-paths ranged from 0.31 to 0.43, <i>p</i> < 0.001), exerting significant and negative indirect effects on psychological distress through the dimension of positive relations with other people. These results could be useful in order to expand the explanatory models of the influence of social intelligence on mental health and to design interventions based on this strength for the promotion of well-being and the reduction in psychological distress.

Title: Integrating Artificial and Human Intelligence: A Partnership for Responsible Innovation in Biomedical Engineering and Medicine.
Year: 2020
Authors: Dzobo Kevin, Adotey Sampson, Thomford Nicholas E, Dzobo Witness
Abstract: Historically, the term "artificial intelligence" dates to 1956 when it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.

Title: Reconfiguring SETI in the microbial context: Panspermia as a solution to Fermi's paradox.
Year: 2021
Authors: Slijepcevic Predrag, Wickramasinghe Chandra
Abstract: All SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) programmes that were conceived and put into practice since the 1960s have been based on anthropocentric ideas concerning the definition of intelligence on a cosmic-wide scale. Brain-based neuronal intelligence, augmented by AI, are currently thought of as being the only form of intelligence that can engage in SETI-type interactions, and this assumption is likely to be connected with the dilemma of the famous Fermi paradox. We argue that high levels of intelligence and cognition inherent in ensembles of bacteria are much more likely to be the dominant form of cosmic intelligence, and the transfer of such intelligence is enabled by the processes of panspermia. We outline the main principles of bacterial intelligence, and how this intelligence may be used by the planetary-scale bacterial system, or the bacteriosphere, through processes of biological tropism, to connect to any extra-terrestrial microbial forms, independently of human interference.

Title: Emotional Intelligence and Teachers' Work Engagement: The Mediating and Moderating Role of Perceived Stress.
Year: 2023
Authors: Mérida-López Sergio, Carvalho Vânia Sofia, Chambel Maria José, Extremera Natalio
Abstract: A growing number of studies have tested the relationship between personal resources (e.g. emotional intelligence) and indicators of occupational well-being, including work engagement. However, few have examined health-related factors moderating or mediating the pathway from emotional intelligence to work engagement. A better knowledge of this area would contribute substantially to the design of effective intervention strategies. The present study's main goal was to test the mediating and moderating role of perceived stress in the association between emotional intelligence and work engagement. The participants comprised 1166 Spanish teaching professionals (744 of whom were female and 537 worked as secondary teachers; M<sub>age</sub> = 44.28 years). The results showed that perceived stress partially mediated the link between emotional intelligence and work engagement. Moreover, the positive relationship between emotional intelligence and work engagement was strengthened among individuals who scored high in perceived stress. The results suggest that multifaceted interventions targeting stress management and emotional intelligence development may facilitate engagement in emotionally demanding occupations such as teaching.

Title: Towards micromachine intelligence: potential of polymers.
Year: 2022
Authors: Ussia Martina, Pumera Martin
Abstract: Inspired by the increasing desire to mimic the perfection of nature, micro- and nanorobots are triggering increasing interest among the scientific community. The development of such tiny machines that can autonomously perform specific and various tasks at a small scale has reached a high-level of complexity over the last 15 years although the transition from hard to soft self-propelled architectures has had the most profound impact. The use of organic components, such as polymers, is of particular interest to fulfill the lack of biocompatibility and biodegradability of inorganic-based microrobots. Additionally, the combination of self-powered micro- and nanorobots with some macromolecules' ability to be deformed and respond to external stimuli is an important topic. This review aims to critically assess the fundamental aspects of smart machines composed of polymers, examine recent advances in the combined systems at the micro- and nanoscale, and discuss the specific contribution of several polymer families. This review elucidates the role of smart polymers in the expanding field of intelligent micromachines.

Title: The paradox of intelligence: Heritability and malleability coexist in hidden gene-environment interplay.
Year: 2018
Authors: Sauce Bruno, Matzel Louis D
Abstract: Intelligence can have an extremely high heritability, but also be malleable; a paradox that has been the source of continuous controversy. Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and advance a frequently overlooked solution to the paradox: Intelligence is a trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of hidden gene-environment (GE) networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of "genetic" effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in intelligence, with malleability existing on top of heritability. The evidence covers cognitive gains consequent to adoption/immigration, changes in IQ's heritability across life span and socioeconomic status, gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive decline, and the gains in intelligence from early education. The GE solution has novel implications for enduring problems, including our inability to identify intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ's "missing heritability"), and the loss of initial benefits from early intervention programs (such as "Head Start"). The GE solution can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in impoverished and underprivileged populations.

Title: Meta-analysis of associations between human brain volume and intelligence differences: How strong are they and what do they mean?
Year: 2015
Authors: Pietschnig Jakob, Penke Lars, Wicherts Jelte M, Zeiler Michael, Voracek Martin
Abstract: Positive associations between human intelligence and brain size have been suspected for more than 150 years. Nowadays, modern non-invasive measures of in vivo brain volume (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) make it possible to reliably assess associations with IQ. By means of a systematic review of published studies and unpublished results obtained by personal communications with researchers, we identified 88 studies examining effect sizes of 148 healthy and clinical mixed-sex samples (>8000 individuals). Our results showed significant positive associations of brain volume and IQ (r=.24, R(2)=.06) that generalize over age (children vs. adults), IQ domain (full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ), and sex. Application of a number of methods for detection of publication bias indicates that strong and positive correlation coefficients have been reported frequently in the literature whilst small and non-significant associations appear to have been often omitted from reports. We show that the strength of the positive association of brain volume and IQ has been overestimated in the literature, but remains robust even when accounting for different types of dissemination bias, although reported effects have been declining over time. While it is tempting to interpret this association in the context of human cognitive evolution and species differences in brain size and cognitive ability, we show that it is not warranted to interpret brain size as an isomorphic proxy of human intelligence differences.

Abstract: Within the animal kingdom, complex brains and high intelligence have evolved several to many times independently, e.g. among ecdysozoans in some groups of insects (e.g. blattoid, dipteran, hymenopteran taxa), among lophotrochozoans in octopodid molluscs, among vertebrates in teleosts (e.g. cichlids), corvid and psittacid birds, and cetaceans, elephants and primates. High levels of intelligence are invariantly bound to multimodal centres such as the mushroom bodies in insects, the vertical lobe in octopodids, the pallium in birds and the cerebral cortex in primates, all of which contain highly ordered associative neuronal networks. The driving forces for high intelligence may vary among the mentioned taxa, e.g. needs for spatial learning and foraging strategies in insects and cephalopods, for social learning in cichlids, instrumental learning and spatial orientation in birds and social as well as instrumental learning in primates.

Title: Socially intelligent machines that learn from humans and help humans learn.
Year: 2023
Authors: Gweon Hyowon, Fan Judith, Kim Been
Abstract: A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to understand and influence other minds. Humans engage in inferential social learning (ISL) by using commonsense psychology to learn from others and help others learn. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are raising new questions about the feasibility of human-machine interactions that support such powerful modes of social learning. Here, we envision what it means to develop socially intelligent machines that can learn, teach, and communicate in ways that are characteristic of ISL. Rather than machines that simply predict human behaviours or recapitulate superficial aspects of human sociality (e.g. smiling, imitating), we should aim to build machines that can learn from human inputs and generate outputs for humans by proactively considering human values, intentions and beliefs. While such machines can inspire next-generation AI systems that learn more effectively from humans (as learners) and even help humans acquire new knowledge (as teachers), achieving these goals will also require scientific studies of its counterpart: how humans reason about machine minds and behaviours. We close by discussing the need for closer collaborations between the AI/ML and cognitive science communities to advance a science of both natural and artificial intelligence. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Cognitive artificial intelligence'.

Title: Jews, Creativity and the Genius of Disobedience.
Year: 2016
Authors: Counted A Victor
Abstract: Jews comprise less than one percent of the world’s population; however, in the second half of the twentieth century and in the twenty-first century Jews have been awarded more than 25 % of the Nobel Prizes. Why are Jews so creative? Some have claimed, they are genetically more intelligent as determined by IQ tests. Whereas there is an intelligence threshold people must reach before being highly creative after this threshold is reached there is no strong relationship between creativity and intelligence. Creative innovation is heavily dependent upon disengagement and divergent thinking as well as subsequent convergent thinking and productivity. The mean by which a person’s brain functions is dependent upon both nature (genetically determined) and nature (learned). In regard to nature, from their earliest age many Jewish children are encouraged to question as well as taught that disobedience in the pursuit of truth and justice is not only justified but is also desirable. Thus, disobedience in this regard is not the cultivation of insolence, but rather gives rise to disengagement and divergent thinking, the critical elements of creativity.Training can also alter the brain, and the Jewish people success in creativity may not be related to their genetically determined IQ, but rather the learned propensity to earnestly question and seek better alternatives.

Title: Intelligence … moving beyond the lowest common denominator.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ackerman Phillip L
Abstract: Despite a century of use in assessing children for predicting academic success, IQ theory and assessments largely overlook the intellectual repertoires of adolescents and adults that are not common, including declarative, procedural, and tacit knowledge. Such knowledge and skill repertoires are essential elements of adult intellectual life and livelihood. A proposal for considering a wider range of knowledge and skills in the definition and assessment of intelligence is offered, along with ideas for moving forward in both research and applications. When intelligence is considered beyond the lowest common denominator, it is clear that there are many important questions have yet to be answered about adolescent and adult intellectual development, maintenance, and decline, occupational performance, relations between intelligence and nonability traits, and the role of engagement in day-to-day intellectual functioning. The proposed focus is to reconsider what it means to be an intelligent adult beyond the IQ measures and to recognize that adults, on average, are far more "intelligent" than they have been considered to be by traditional IQ assessments developed over the last century.

Title: Toward an ethics of autopoietic technology: Stress, care, and intelligence.
Year: 2023
Authors: Witkowski Olaf, Doctor Thomas, Solomonova Elizaveta, Duane Bill, Levin Michael
Abstract: The relationship between humans and technology has attracted increasing attention with the advent of ever stronger models of artificial intelligence. Humans and technology are intertwined within multiple autopoietic loops of stress, care, and intelligence. This paper suggests that technology should not be seen as a mere tool serving humans' needs, but rather as a partner in a rich relationship with humans. Our model for understanding autopoietic systems applies equally to biological, technological, and hybrid systems. Regardless of their substrates, all intelligent agents can be understood as needing to respond to a perceived mismatch between what is and what should be. We take this observation, which is evidence of intrinsic links between ontology and ethics, as the basis for proposing a stress-care-intelligence feedback loop (SCI loop for short). We note that the SCI loop provides a perspective on agency that does not require recourse to explanatorily burdensome notions of permanent and singular essences. SCI loops can be seen as individuals only by virtue of their dynamics, and are thus intrinsically integrative and transformational. We begin by considering the transition from poiesis to autopoiesis in Heidegger and the subsequent enactivist tradition, and on this basis formulate and explain the SCI loop. In an acknowledgment of Maturana's and Varela's project, our findings are considered against the backdrop of a classic Buddhist model for the cultivation of intelligence, known as the bodhisattva. We conclude by noting that SCI loops of human and technological agency can be seen as mutually integrative by noticing the stress-transfers between them. The loop framework thus acknowledges encounters and interactions between humans and technology in a way that does not relegate one to the subservience of the other (neither in ontological nor in ethical terms), suggesting instead integration and mutual respect as the default for their engagements. Moreover, an acknowledgment of diverse, multiscale embodiments of intelligence suggests an expansive model of ethics not bound by artificial, limited criteria based on privileged composition or history of an agent. The implications for our journey into the future appear numerous.

Title: An Extended AI-Experience: Industry 5.0 in Creative Product Innovation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Grech Amy, Mehnen Jörn, Wodehouse Andrew
Abstract: Creativity plays a significant role in competitive product ideation. With the increasing emergence of Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, the link between such technologies and product ideation is explored in this research to assist and augment creative scenarios in the engineering field. A bibliographic analysis is performed to review relevant fields and their relationships. This is followed by a review of current challenges in group ideation and state-of-the-art technologies with the aim of addressing them in this study. This knowledge is applied to the transformation of current ideation scenarios into a virtual environment using AI. The aim is to augment designers' creative experiences, a core value of Industry 5.0 that focuses on human-centricity, social and ecological benefits. For the first time, this research reclaims brainstorming as a challenging and inspiring activity where participants are fully engaged through a combination of AI and VR technologies. This activity is enhanced through three key areas: facilitation, stimulation, and immersion. These areas are integrated through intelligent team moderation, enhanced communication techniques, and access to multi-sensory stimuli during the collaborative creative process, therefore providing a platform for future research into Industry 5.0 and smart product development.

Title: Empathy, emotional intelligence and interprofessional skills in healthcare education.
Year: 2023
Authors: McNulty Jonathan P, Politis Yurgos
Abstract: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health professionals maintain the health of citizens through evidence-based medicine and caring. Students enroled in health professional programmes are required to have successfully attained all core learning outcomes by reaching key milestones throughout the course of their studies, demonstrating they have developed the required graduate skills and attributes upon completion of the programme. While some of the knowledge, skills and competencies that make up these learning outcomes are very discipline specific, there are more general professional skills across all disciplines which are difficult to define, such as empathy, emotional intelligence and interprofessional skills. These are at the heart of all health professional programmes that once defined, can be mapped through curricula and further evaluated. Literature will be presented on these three professional skills: empathy, emotional intelligence, and interprofessional skills, based on studies that focussed primarily in health professional programmes and highlight some of the key findings and issues at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The paper will present the need for these skills to be defined and then mapped through curricula so that students are better supported in their professional development. Empathy, emotional intelligence and interprofessional skills transcend the discipline specific skills and as such it is important that all educators consider how best these may be fostered. Efforts should also be made to further the integration of these professional skills within curricula to produce health professionals with an enhanced focus on person-centred care.

Title: A neuro-cognitive process model of emotional intelligence.
Year: 2018
Authors: Smith Ryan, Killgore William D S, Alkozei Anna, Lane Richard D
Abstract: The construct of emotional intelligence (EI) broadly reflects the idea that individuals differ in their disposition/ability to adaptively generate, recognize, understand, and regulate the emotions of self and others. However, while the neural processes underlying such differences have begun to receive investigation, no brain-based model of EI has yet been proposed to help guide the design and interpretation of neuroimaging research in this area. In this article, we propose a neural model of EI to fill this need. This model incorporates recent insights from emotion theory, computational neuroscience, and large-scale network models of brain function. It also highlights several domain general processes - including those underlying conceptualization, automatic attention, habit formation, and cognitive control - that offer plausible targets for improving EI with training. Our model offers considerable promise in advancing understanding of intelligent emotional functioning and in guiding future neuroscience research on EI.

Title: The signature-testing approach to mapping biological and artificial intelligences.
Year: 2022
Authors: Taylor Alex H, Bastos Amalia P M, Brown Rachael L, Allen Colin
Abstract: Making inferences from behaviour to cognition is problematic due to a many-to-one mapping problem, in which any one behaviour can be generated by multiple possible cognitive processes. Attempts to cross this inferential gap when comparing human intelligence to that of animals or machines can generate great debate. Here, we discuss the challenges of making comparisons using 'success-testing' approaches and call attention to an alternate experimental framework, the 'signature-testing' approach. Signature testing places the search for information-processing errors, biases, and other patterns centre stage, rather than focussing predominantly on problem-solving success. We highlight current research on both biological and artificial intelligence that fits within this framework and is creating proactive research programs that make strong inferences about the similarities and differences between the content of human, animal, and machine minds.

Title: Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience towards the Diagnosis of Neurological Disorders-A Scoping Review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Surianarayanan Chellammal, Lawrence John Jeyasekaran, Chelliah Pethuru Raj, Prakash Edmond, Hewage Chaminda
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that deals with the simulation of human intelligence using machines so that such machines gain problem-solving and decision-making capabilities similar to that of the human brain. Neuroscience is the scientific study of the struczture and cognitive functions of the brain. Neuroscience and AI are mutually interrelated. These two fields help each other in their advancements. The theory of neuroscience has brought many distinct improvisations into the AI field. The biological neural network has led to the realization of complex deep neural network architectures that are used to develop versatile applications, such as text processing, speech recognition, object detection, etc. Additionally, neuroscience helps to validate the existing AI-based models. Reinforcement learning in humans and animals has inspired computer scientists to develop algorithms for reinforcement learning in artificial systems, which enables those systems to learn complex strategies without explicit instruction. Such learning helps in building complex applications, like robot-based surgery, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, etc. In turn, with its ability to intelligently analyze complex data and extract hidden patterns, AI fits as a perfect choice for analyzing neuroscience data that are very complex. Large-scale AI-based simulations help neuroscientists test their hypotheses. Through an interface with the brain, an AI-based system can extract the brain signals and commands that are generated according to the signals. These commands are fed into devices, such as a robotic arm, which helps in the movement of paralyzed muscles or other human parts. AI has several use cases in analyzing neuroimaging data and reducing the workload of radiologists. The study of neuroscience helps in the early detection and diagnosis of neurological disorders. In the same way, AI can effectively be applied to the prediction and detection of neurological disorders. Thus, in this paper, a scoping review has been carried out on the mutual relationship between AI and neuroscience, emphasizing the convergence between AI and neuroscience in order to detect and predict various neurological disorders.

Title: No Evidence for a Relationship between Intelligence and Ejaculate Quality.
Year: 2020
Authors: DeLecce Tara, Fink Bernhard, Shackelford Todd, Abed Mohaned G
Abstract: Genetic quality may be expressed through many traits simultaneously, and this would suggest a phenotype-wide fitness factor. In humans, intelligence has been positively associated with several potential indicators of genetic quality, including ejaculate quality. We conducted a conceptual replication of one such study by investigating the relationship between intelligence (assessed by the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices Test-Short Form) and ejaculate quality (indexed by sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility) in a sample of 41 men (ages ranging 18 to 33 years; <i>M</i> = 23.33; <i>SD</i> = 3.60). By self-report, participants had not had a vasectomy, and had never sought infertility treatment. We controlled for several covariates known to affect ejaculate quality (e.g., abstinence duration before providing an ejaculate) and found no statistically significant relationship between intelligence and ejaculate quality; our findings, therefore, do not match those of Arden, Gottfredson, Miller et al. or those of previous studies. We discuss limitations of this study and the general research area and highlight the need for future research in this area, especially the need for larger data sets to address questions around phenotypic quality and ejaculate quality.

Title: Life as an Intelligence Test: Intelligence, Education, and Behavioral Genetics.
Year: 2022
Authors: Scherz Paul
Abstract: Using the large datasets available with new gene sequencing and biobank projects, behavioral geneticists are developing tools that attempt to predict individual intelligence based on genetics. These predictive tools are meant to enable a 'precision education' that will transform society. These technological developments have not changed the fundamental aims of a program with a long history. Behavioral genetics is continuous with previous attempts to match personal characteristics to heredity, such as sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, and threatens racial and other forms of bias. From these older paradigms, it inherits an understanding of intelligence as informational processing shaped by mechanistic and computational metaphors as well as a view of society and education organized around competition. Because of these influences, these models misdescribe fundamental aspects of human engagement with the world and disregard other concepts of intelligence, which creates problems for the precision education that researchers hope to construct using genetic knowledge.

Title: When people estimate their personal intelligence who is overconfident? Who is accurate?
Year: 2020
Authors: Mayer John D, Panter A T, Caruso David R
Abstract: We explore accurate self-knowledge versus overconfidence in personal intelligence-a "broad" intelligence about personality. The theory of personal intelligence proposes that people vary in their ability to understand the traits, goals, plans, and actions of themselves and others. We wondered who accurately knew that they were higher in personal intelligence and who did not, and whether individuals with more accurate estimates were distinguishable from others in their psychological characteristics.

Title: Exploiting machine learning for bestowing intelligence to microfluidics.
Year: 2021
Authors: Zheng Jiahao, Cole Tim, Zhang Yuxin, Kim Jeeson, Tang Shi-Yang
Abstract: Intelligent microfluidics is an emerging cross-discipline research area formed by combining microfluidics with machine learning. It uses the advantages of microfluidics, such as high throughput and controllability, and the powerful data processing capabilities of machine learning, resulting in improved systems in biotechnology and chemistry. Compared to traditional microfluidics using manual analysis methods, intelligent microfluidics needs less human intervention, and results in a more user-friendly experience with faster processing. There is a paucity of literature reviewing this burgeoning and highly promising cross-discipline. Therefore, we herein comprehensively and systematically summarize several aspects of microfluidic applications enabled by machine learning. We list the types of microfluidics used in intelligent microfluidic applications over the last five years, as well as the machine learning algorithms and the hardware used for training. We also present the most recent advances in key technologies, developments, challenges, and the emerging opportunities created by intelligent microfluidics.

Title: Emotional intelligence and academic performance among medical students - a correlational study.
Year: 2023
Authors: Alvi T, Nadakuditi R L, Alotaibi T H, Aisha A, Ahmad M S, Ahmad S
Abstract: Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor one's emotions and feelings and those of others, to distinguish between them, and to use this information to guide one's thoughts and actions. A growing body of evidence suggests that highly emotionally intelligent student groups have better academic performance, better emotional awareness, and relationship management. We set forward to determine if any such positive relation exists among medical students.

Title: Natural Intelligence as the Brain of Intelligent Systems.
Year: 2023
Authors: Naghshvarianjahromi Mahdi, Kumar Shiva, Deen Mohammed Jamal
Abstract: This article discusses the concept and applications of cognitive dynamic systems (CDS), which are a type of intelligent system inspired by the brain. There are two branches of CDS, one for linear and Gaussian environments (LGEs), such as cognitive radio and cognitive radar, and another one for non-Gaussian and nonlinear environments (NGNLEs), such as cyber processing in smart systems. Both branches use the same principle, called the perception action cycle (PAC), to make decisions. The focus of this review is on the applications of CDS, including cognitive radios, cognitive radar, cognitive control, cyber security, self-driving cars, and smart grids for LGEs. For NGNLEs, the article reviews the use of CDS in smart e-healthcare applications and software-defined optical communication systems (SDOCS), such as smart fiber optic links. The results of implementing CDS in these systems are very promising, with improved accuracy, performance, and lower computational costs. For example, CDS implementation in cognitive radars achieved a range estimation error that is as good as 0.47 (m) and a velocity estimation error of 3.30 (m/s), outperforming traditional active radars. Similarly, CDS implementation in smart fiber optic links improved the quality factor by 7 dB and the maximum achievable data rate by 43% compared to those of other mitigation techniques.

Title: Mechanisms of automaticity and anticipatory control in fluid intelligence.
Year: 2017
Authors: Joyce Arthur W
Abstract: The constructs of fluid (Gf) and crystalized (Gc) intelligence represent an early attempt to describe the mechanisms of problem solving in the vertebrate brain. Modern neuroscience demonstrates that problem solving involves interplay between the mechanisms of automaticity and anticipatory control, enabling nature's elegant solution to the challenges animals face in their environment. Studies of neural functioning are making clear the primary role of cortical-subcortical interactions in the manifestation of intelligent behavior in humans and other vertebrates. A tridimensional model of intelligent problem solving is explored, wherein the basal ganglia system (BGS) and cerebrocerebellar system (CCS) interact within large scale brain networks. The BGS and CCS work together to enable automaticity to occur. The BGS enables the organism to learn what to do through a powerful instrumental learning system. The BGS also regulates when behavior is released through an inhibitory system which is incredibly sensitive to context. The CCS enables the organism to learn how to perform adaptive behaviors. Internal cerebellar models enable gradual improvements in the quality of behavioral output. The BGS and CCS interact within large scale brain networks, including the dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN). The interactions of these systems enable vertebrate organisms to develop a vast array of complex adaptive behaviors. The benefits and importance of developing clinical tests to measure the integrity of these systems is considered.

Title: Plans or Outcomes: How Do We Attribute Intelligence to Others?
Year: 2021
Authors: Kryven Marta, Ullman Tomer D, Cowan William, Tenenbaum Joshua B
Abstract: Humans routinely make inferences about both the contents and the workings of other minds based on observed actions. People consider what others want or know, but also how intelligent, rational, or attentive they might be. Here, we introduce a new methodology for quantitatively studying the mechanisms people use to attribute intelligence to others based on their behavior. We focus on two key judgments previously proposed in the literature: judgments based on observed outcomes (you're smart if you won the game) and judgments based on evaluating the quality of an agent's planning that led to their outcomes (you're smart if you made the right choice, even if you didn't succeed). We present a novel task, the maze search task (MST), in which participants rate the intelligence of agents searching a maze for a hidden goal. We model outcome-based attributions based on the observed utility of the agent upon achieving a goal, with higher utilities indicating higher intelligence, and model planning-based attributions by measuring the proximity of the observed actions to an ideal planner, such that agents who produce closer approximations of optimal plans are seen as more intelligent. We examine human attributions of intelligence in three experiments that use MST and find that participants used both outcome and planning as indicators of intelligence. However, observing the outcome was not necessary, and participants still made planning-based attributions of intelligence when the outcome was not observed. We also found that the weights individuals placed on plans and on outcome correlated with an individual's ability to engage in cognitive reflection. Our results suggest that people attribute intelligence based on plans given sufficient context and cognitive resources and rely on the outcome when computational resources or context are limited.

Title: Relationship between emotional intelligence and disaster response self-efficacy: A comparative study in nurses.
Year: 2023
Authors: Doğan Kuday Ahmet, Erdoğan Özcan
Abstract: Nurses who constitute an important part of the health system play a critical role in all stages of disaster management, especially in providing care for disaster victims. It is essential for nurses to have adequate education and qualifications to reduce disaster-related mortality and morbidity rates in the community. The qualifications of nurses depend not only on their knowledge and skills but also on their emotional abilities such as empathy and stress management. Emotions can impact individuals' levels of self-efficacy in disaster response, and it may help explain the differences in self-efficacy among nurses.

Title: A Holistic Approach of Personality Traits in Medical Students: An Integrative Review.
Year: 2021
Authors: Suciu Nicoleta, Meliț Lorena Elena, Mărginean Cristina Oana
Abstract: Personality is one of the most crucial aspects of human life, since it influences all human behaviours in both personal and social life, and might also trigger important conflicts with a person's surroundings in the setting of incompatible traits and characteristics. It is true that 'one must be born' for a certain medical specialty, but several components of personality might be educated with proper training. Increased levels of Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness associated with lower levels of Neuroticism might represent the key combination for achieving professional satisfaction in the medical profession. Medical students should receive proper interprofessional education, since effective interprofessional relationships among healthcare providers definitely improve patients' safety. Empathy contributes to effective patient-physician communication, improving patient trust, compliance, and satisfaction, being positively correlated with Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Extraversion. Emotional intelligence-the capacity to respond to one's own and others' emotions-was proven to contribute, in a synergistic way with empathy, to increasing empathic ability. Clinical communication skills represent a key component in medical students in order to achieve the best patient care, and they are certainly related and/or influenced by empathy, interprofessional collaboration skills, emotional intelligence and, especially, personality traits. Taking into account the complex interactions mentioned above, the implementation of effective courses based on these concepts in medical students, intending to promote the development of clinical communication skills, represents a real emergency, since it might result in a reduction in medical errors and subsequent related deaths. A thorough understanding of students' personality is mandatory before designing these courses in order to provide a training tailored to their personality styles.

Title: Intelligent biosensing strategies for rapid detection in food safety: A review.
Year: 2022
Authors: Zhang Junjie, Huang Huixian, Song Guangchun, Huang Kunlun, Luo Yunbo, Liu Qingliang, He Xiaoyun, Cheng Nan
Abstract: With the development of the economy and progress in science and technology, people are paying increasing attention to food safety, and food safety testing technology has also developed rapidly. Biosensors, one type of detection technology, stand out due to their high sensitivity and specificity. In combination with emerging technologies, such as smartphones, 3D printing, artificial sensing and the Internet of Things (IOT), biosensor technology has been increasingly developed. The future development of food detection requires intelligence, portability and sensitivity. Based on these factors, we reviewed the research progress regarding the intelligence of biosensors in recent years, expound the research situation based on various biosensor intelligent technologies and equipment, and forecast the future applications of intelligent biosensors.

Title: Developing Emotional Intelligence through Physical Education: A Systematic Review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Rico-González Markel
Abstract: The development of Emotional Intelligence (EI) has gained importance in the context of goals to spur a new generation of people intent upon improving human health. Physical education (PE) is a suitable curriculum subject in which to train EI. Therefore, our aim in this review is to summarize existing literature pertaining to EI within PE, while seeking particular guidance on how to best teach EI. We systematically reviewed PubMed, ERIC, Education Database, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane, and FECYT (i.e., Web of Sciences, CCC, DIIDW, KJD, MEDLINE, RSCI, and SCIELO) databases up to January 24, 2022. From 248 studies initially located, 28 were included in a final qualitative synthesis. These 28 studies were sub-divided into (i) correlation and (ii) intervention studies with an intervention group, possibly a control group, and with pre-test and post-test outcome measures. There was a clear correlation between EI-motivation and EI-psychological needs, and there emerged the following types of educational programs for developing EI within PE: (a) pedagogical models based on corporal expression and relaxation, (b) Cooperative Learning (e.g., the Sport Education Model), (c) community engagement interventions (e.g., Social-Emotional Learning, the Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility model, and Service Learning), and (d) augmented reality games. Most successful EI programs included themes of collaborative work, concern for others, and social welfare. Including EI as a PE goal will require developing students' personality and encouraging PE teachers to focus on EI within pedagogical models based on community engagement.

Title: Emotional Intelligence as a Predictor of Motivation, Anxiety and Leadership in Athletes.
Year: 2022
Authors: Rubio Isabel Mercader, Ángel Nieves Gutiérrez, Esteban María Dolores Pérez, Ruiz Nieves Fátima Oropesa
Abstract: Nowadays, emotional intelligence is not only understood as the recognition of our own emotions but also the regulation of these emotions. In the field of sports, the concept of sports leadership is increasingly relevant, understood as a behavioral and cognitive process closely related to sports success, based on interpersonal relationships, trust, respect and the feeling of coherence. In this study, we intend to analyze the relationship between sports success and emotional intelligence to verify their relationship and the influence of other variables such as sports anxiety. As a sample, we took a total of 165 active sportsmen and women studying for both undergraduate and master's degrees related to the sciences of physical activity and sport. The expected results aim to demonstrate the relationship between emotional intelligence, sports leadership and sports anxiety.

Title: The evolution of general intelligence.
Year: 2017
Authors: Burkart Judith M, Schubiger Michèle N, van Schaik Carel P
Abstract: The presence of general intelligence poses a major evolutionary puzzle, which has led to increased interest in its presence in nonhuman animals. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate this question and to explore the implications for current theories about the evolution of cognition. We first review domain-general and domain-specific accounts of human cognition in order to situate attempts to identify general intelligence in nonhuman animals. Recent studies are consistent with the presence of general intelligence in mammals (rodents and primates). However, the interpretation of a psychometric g factor as general intelligence needs to be validated, in particular in primates, and we propose a range of such tests. We then evaluate the implications of general intelligence in nonhuman animals for current theories about its evolution and find support for the cultural intelligence approach, which stresses the critical importance of social inputs during the ontogenetic construction of survival-relevant skills. The presence of general intelligence in nonhumans implies that modular abilities can arise in two ways, primarily through automatic development with fixed content and secondarily through learning and automatization with more variable content. The currently best-supported model, for humans and nonhuman vertebrates alike, thus construes the mind as a mix of skills based on primary and secondary modules. The relative importance of these two components is expected to vary widely among species, and we formulate tests to quantify their strength.

Title: [Modulation of the expression of high intellectual capacity].
Year: 2020
Authors: Sastre-Riba Sylvia
Abstract: Recent research demystifies and redefines high intellectual ability (HIA) against the traditional monolithic and static concept which was based on heritability and identification through an intelligence quotient. This concept is replaced by another in which the HIA is understood as a complex phenomenon of a genetic and environmental nature This is the result of a covariation along the life path between endogenous and exogenous forces, modulators of the high potential (predictor factor) towards the optimal expression, or not, of its eminence in adulthood. Then, HIA implies the conjunction of a starting biological diversity (the high potential), a psychological diversity related to the exploitation of biological resources in useful functions and knowledge, and a contextual diversity configured by different family conditions, as well as socio-cultural and economic contexts. The aim of this work is to present from a neuroconstructivist perspective a review of the current HIA research on the predictive and modulating factors. In the conclusions, we discuss the incidence of the modulating variables in the various trajectories of potential development towards possible adult eminence and the diagnostic and educational implications that are derived.

Title: Efficiency of mitochondrial functioning as the fundamental biological mechanism of general intelligence (g).
Year: 2018
Authors: Geary David C
Abstract: General intelligence or g is one of the most thoroughly studied concepts in the behavioral sciences. Measures of intelligence are predictive of a wide range of educational, occupational, and life outcomes, including creative productivity and are systematically related to physical health and successful aging. The nexus of relations suggests 1 or several fundamental biological mechanisms underlie g, health, and aging, among other outcomes. Cell-damaging oxidative stress has been proposed as 1 of many potential mechanisms, but the proposal is underdeveloped and does not capture other important mitochondrial functions. I flesh out this proposal and argue that the overall efficiency of mitochondrial functioning is a core component of g; the most fundamental biological mechanism common to all brain and cognitive processes and that contributes to the relations among intelligence, health, and aging. The proposal integrates research on intelligence with models of the centrality of mitochondria to brain development and functioning, neurological diseases, and health more generally. Moreover, the combination of the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the evolution of compensatory nuclear DNA, and the inability of evolutionary processes to purge deleterious mtDNA in males may contribute to the sex difference in variability in intelligence and in other cognitive domains. The proposal unifies many now disparate literatures and generates testable predictions for future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).

Authors: Piantadosi Steven T, Kidd Celeste
Abstract: We present evidence that pressures for early childcare may have been one of the driving factors of human evolution. We show through an evolutionary model that runaway selection for high intelligence may occur when (i) altricial neonates require intelligent parents, (ii) intelligent parents must have large brains, and (iii) large brains necessitate having even more altricial offspring. We test a prediction of this account by showing across primate genera that the helplessness of infants is a particularly strong predictor of the adults' intelligence. We discuss related implications, including this account's ability to explain why human-level intelligence evolved specifically in mammals. This theory complements prior hypotheses that link human intelligence to social reasoning and reproductive pressures and explains how human intelligence may have become so distinctive compared with our closest evolutionary relatives.

Title: Neuromythology of Einstein's brain.
Year: 2014
Authors: Hines Terence
Abstract: The idea that the brain of the great physicist Albert Einstein is different from "average" brains in both cellular structure and external shape is widespread. This belief is based on several studies examining Einstein's brain both histologically and morphologically. This paper reviews these studies and finds them wanting. Their results do not, in fact, provide support for the claim that the structure of Einstein's brain reflects his intellectual abilities.

Title: Blockchain for Future Wireless Networks: A Decade Survey.
Year: 2022
Authors: Rathod Tejal, Jadav Nilesh Kumar, Alshehri Mohammad Dahman, Tanwar Sudeep, Sharma Ravi, Felseghi Raluca-Andreea, Raboaca Maria Simona
Abstract: The emerging need for high data rate, low latency, and high network capacity encourages wireless networks (WNs) to build intelligent and dynamic services, such as intelligent transportation systems, smart homes, smart cities, industrial automation, etc. However, the WN is impeded by several security threats, such as data manipulation, denial-of-service, injection, man-in-the-middle, session hijacking attacks, etc., that deteriorate the security performance of the aforementioned WN-based intelligent services. Toward this goal, various security solutions, such as cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), access control, authentication, etc., are proposed by the scientific community around the world; however, they do not have full potential in tackling the aforementioned security issues. Therefore, it necessitates a technology, i.e., a blockchain, that offers decentralization, immutability, transparency, and security to protect the WN from security threats. Motivated by these facts, this paper presents a WNs survey in the context of security and privacy issues with blockchain-based solutions. First, we analyzed the existing research works and highlighted security requirements, security issues in a different generation of WN (4G, 5G, and 6G), and a comparative analysis of existing security solutions. Then, we showcased the influence of blockchain technology and prepared an exhaustive taxonomy for blockchain-enabled security solutions in WN. Further, we also proposed a blockchain and a 6G-based WN architecture to highlight the importance of blockchain technology in WN. Moreover, the proposed architecture is evaluated against different performance metrics, such as scalability, packet loss ratio, and latency. Finally, we discuss various open issues and research challenges for blockchain-based WNs solutions.

Title: Intelligent Insulin vs. Artificial Intelligence for Type 1 Diabetes: Will the Real Winner Please Stand Up?
Year: 2023
Authors: Cambuli Valentina Maria, Baroni Marco Giorgio
Abstract: Research in the treatment of type 1 diabetes has been addressed into two main areas: the development of "intelligent insulins" capable of auto-regulating their own levels according to glucose concentrations, or the exploitation of artificial intelligence (AI) and its learning capacity, to provide decision support systems to improve automated insulin therapy. This review aims to provide a synthetic overview of the current state of these two research areas, providing an outline of the latest development in the search for "intelligent insulins," and the results of new and promising advances in the use of artificial intelligence to regulate automated insulin infusion and glucose control. The future of insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes appears promising with AI, with research nearly reaching the possibility of finally having a "closed-loop" artificial pancreas.

Title: Designing Intelligent Tools for Creative People.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shugrina Maria, Pattanaik Sumanta N
Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) poised to transform the nature of creative media, it is especially important to design tools with the creative process in mind. While ample research demonstrates the importance of flow, playfulness, and exploration for creative tasks, these concepts are rarely considered when designing digital interfaces. My thesis develops principles for the design of intelligent and playful user interfaces through a series of concrete design tasks. I explore a number of approaches for establishing artist needs, develop digital representations that are amenable to both machine learning and user interaction, and design novel digital media that amplify, not stifle, creativity. I conclude with an informal design philosophy developed throughout this study and thoughts on how we can leverage AI to elevate human creativity.

Title: The Negative Intelligence-Religiosity Relation: New and Confirming Evidence.
Year: 2020
Authors: Zuckerman Miron, Li Chen, Lin Shengxin, Hall Judith A
Abstract: Zuckerman et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis of 63 studies that showed a negative intelligence-religiosity relation (IRR). As more studies have become available and because some of Zuckerman et al.'s (2013) conclusions have been challenged, we conducted a new meta-analysis with an updated data set of 83 studies. Confirming previous conclusions, the new analysis showed that the correlation between intelligence and religious beliefs in college and noncollege samples ranged from -.20 to -.23. There was no support for mediation of the IRR by education but there was support for partial mediation by analytic cognitive style. Thus, one possible interpretation for the IRR is that intelligent people are more likely to use analytic style (i.e., approach problems more rationally). An alternative (and less interesting) reason for the mediation is that tests of both intelligence and analytic style assess cognitive ability. Additional empirical and theoretical work is needed to resolve this issue.

Title: Does exposure to nature make children more intelligent? Analysis in Polish children with and without ADHD.
Year: 2023
Authors: Buczyłowska Dorota, Baumbach Clemens, Bratkowski Jakub, Mysak Yarema, Wierzba-Łukaszyk Maja, Skotak Krzysztof, Sitnik-Warchulska Katarzyna, Lipowska Małgorzata, Izydorczyk Bernadetta, Szwed Marcin, Markevych Iana
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that exposure to nature and physical activity (PA) may be associated with higher intelligence in children. We examined whether there is an association between lifelong exposure to greenspace and bluespace and intelligence in children aged 10-13 with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and whether PA mediates this association. The sample (N = 714) was collected within the NeuroSmog case-control study, where children with (N = 206) and without ADHD (N = 508) were recruited from 18 towns in Southern Poland. Nature exposure was estimated as the sum of the z-scores of the objective and perceived measures. Objective greenspace exposure was defined as the percentage of grass and tree cover in 500 m and 1 km buffers around lifelong residential addresses, respectively. Objective bluespace exposure was defined as the percentage of water cover in 500 m and 1 km buffers. Perceived greenspace/bluespace was measured as the parent-rated availability, quality, and use of greenspace/bluespace. Intelligence was assessed using the Polish version of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, 5th edition (SB5). SB5 Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Nonverbal IQ, Verbal IQ, five factor and ten subtest scores were analysed as outcomes. The associations between nature and IQ scores were assessed by linear regressions separately for cases and controls, adjusting the models for sex, parental education, and urbanicity. Structural equation modeling was implemented to test whether PA mediated the association between nature and intelligence. None of the greenspace or bluespace measures were consistently associated with intelligence. PA was not found to be a mediator. We did not find evidence that higher lifelong nature exposure is associated with higher intelligence in Polish schoolchildren with or without ADHD. This casts doubts on whether exposure to nature has relevant influence on IQ.

Title: More intelligent extraverts are more likely to deceive.
Year: 2017
Authors: Sarzyńska Justyna, Falkiewicz Marcel, Riegel Monika, Babula Justyna, Margulies Daniel S, Nęcka Edward, Grabowska Anna, Szatkowska Iwona
Abstract: The tendency to lie is a part of personality. But are personality traits the only factors that make some people lie more often than others? We propose that cognitive abilities have equal importance. People with higher cognitive abilities are better, and thus more effective liars. This might reinforce using lies to solve problems. Yet, there is no empirical research that shows this relationship in healthy adults. Here we present three studies in which the participants had free choice about their honesty. We related differences in cognitive abilities and personality to the odds of lying. Results show that personality and intelligence are both important. People low on agreeableness and intelligent extraverts are most likely to lie. This suggests that intelligence might mediate the relationship between personality traits and lying frequency. While personality traits set general behavioral tendencies, intelligence and environment set boundaries.

Title: The Relationship of Perceptions of Hospice and Palliative Care With Emotional Intelligence and Cognitive Empathy in Nursing Students.
Year: 2020
Authors: Kang Se-Won, Choi Eun-Jin
Abstract: This study aimed to identify the relationships of perception of hospice and palliative care with emotional intelligence and cognitive empathy in nursing students. The participants were 458 nursing students. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficients, independent-samples t test, and binary logistic regression. Perception of hospice and palliative care was significantly and positively correlated with emotional intelligence (r = 0.224, P < .001) and cognitive empathy (r = 0.311, P < .001). Mean score differences of perception of hospice and palliative care by emotional intelligence and cognitive empathy were statistically significant (t = -3.973, P < .001; t = -4.109, P < .001, respectively). Logistic regression yielded an odds ratio of 1.860 (P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 1.283-2.698) between the perception of hospice and palliative care and emotional intelligence and an odds ratio of 2.028 (P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 1.394-2.951) between the perception of hospice and palliative care and cognitive empathy. Emotional intelligence and cognitive empathy should be cultivated to raise nursing students' perception of hospice and palliative care and must be included when developing related curricula and extracurricular programs.

Title: The influence of general knowledge test performance on self-ratings of and perceived relationships between intelligence, knowledge, and memory.
Year: 2023
Authors: Coane Jennifer H, Cipollini John, Beaulieu Charlotte, Song Julianna, Umanath Sharda
Abstract: The present study examined how taking a general knowledge (GK) test affects perceptions of one's intelligence, memory, and knowledge and the relationship between these three constructs. Participants rated their abilities on each construct and the strength of the relationships between them before and after completing an easy or hard GK test or control task. In Experiment 1, participants were (mis)informed that GK questions were correctly answered by 50% of the population; in Experiment 2, no such information was provided. Regardless of (mis)information about others' performance, participants in the Hard condition believed they had a worse memory, were less knowledgeable, and were less intelligent post-task. However, the strength of the perceived relationship between GK and intelligence decreased only when participants were misled. Judgments of one's intelligence, memory, and knowledge can be manipulated by taking a GK test, and individuals engage in self-protective behavior to reduce the potential threat to one's self-concept.

Title: Intelligence correlates with the temporal variability of brain networks.
Year: 2022
Authors: Shi Manqing, Li Yu, Sun Jiangzhou, Li Xinyi, Han Yurong, Liu Zeqing, Qiu Jiang
Abstract: Intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand objective things, and use knowledge and experience to solve problems. Highly intelligent people show the ability to switch between different thought patterns and shift their mental focus. This suggests a link between intelligence and the dynamic interaction of brain networks. Thus, we investigated the relationships between resting-state dynamic brain network remodeling (temporal variability) and scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale using a large dataset comprising 606 individuals. We found that performance intelligence was associated with greater temporal variability in the functional connectivity patterns of the dorsal attention network. High variability in these areas indicates flexible connectivity patterns, which may contribute to cognitive processes such as attention selection. In addition, performance intelligence was related to greater temporal variability in the functional connectivity patterns of the salience network. Thus, this study revealed a close relationship between performance intelligence and high variability in brain networks involved in attentional choice, spatial orientation, and cognitive control.

Title: Integrated Development of Artificial Intelligence and Economic Management.
Year: 2022
Authors: He Yixing, Ding Haolun
Abstract: The world economy is developing rapidly. Behind the rapid development, the management of economic regions is very important. In the process of economic management, the government plays the role of macrocontrol and is responsible for the management of various economic affairs and social and economic services. While undertaking infrastructure construction, it creates a good environment for economic development. However, with the deepening of economic development and the more and more complex economic data, the current economic management has gradually exposed a range of issues that arise during the process of economic development, and these problems need to be solved urgently. At this time, the application scope of artificial intelligence in the economic field is getting wider and wider, and it has a great positive effect on economic development. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of economic management in the process of economic development, this paper proposes a development path that integrates AI and economic management and provides intelligent technology support for the development of economic management to help the smooth operation of economic development. In addition, this paper shows through experiments that the path of integration of AI and economic management can promote the development and smooth operation of the economy, and AI has a positive impact on economic management.

Title: Rehabilitation Treatment of Muscle Strain in Athlete Training under Intelligent Intervention.
Year: 2022
Authors: Qiao Yu, Zhang Lei, Zhang Bin
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence technology in the medical field, clinical trials using artificial intelligence as an intervention method are constantly emerging. This article mainly introduces the intervention of artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence on the rehabilitation of athletes' muscle strains. Among them, artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence are a brand-new nursing intervention method. This article compares conventional rehabilitation therapy with these two new types of intelligent interventions to explore the effects of artificial intelligence intervention and emotional intelligence intervention in the rehabilitation of athletes. The experimental results show that the average number of muscle restrains under the intervention of artificial intelligence is 4.1 times, the average restrain rate of muscles is 27.7%, and the average recovery degree of athletes is 94.7%. The average SPB score under emotional intelligence intervention was 56 points. Artificial intelligence interventions can enhance rehabilitation through advanced technology, and emotional intelligence interventions can provide emotional support to effectively improve treatment outcomes and quality of life.

Title: Associating Growth Mindset with Emotional Intelligence and Why It's Needed for Professional Identity Formation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Cleven Anita J, Renaud Amy, Larose-Pierre Margareth, McQuade Brianna, Griffin Brooke L, Johnson Charisse, Hughes Jeremy A
Abstract: Nurturing professional identity formation (PIF) is incumbent for the future of a pharmacist. The process of PIF incorporates norms, roles, and expectations of the profession into existing identities. This process can be particularly challenging when there are conflicting identities that provoke strong emotional experiences. Emotions are driven by beliefs and thoughts which serve as the catalyst for our reactions and behavior. Dealing with strong emotions can be uncomfortable, requiring proper regulation and management. Emotional intelligence and a growth mindset are fundamental traits that significantly influence a learner's ability to navigate the emotional complexities and thoughts associated with PIF. Although there is some evidence in the literature on the benefits of cultivating emotionally intelligent pharmacists there is a paucity of information on its association with growth mindset and PIF. Emotional intelligence and growth mindset are not mutually exclusive traits and development of both is needed for a learner's professional identity.

Title: Same/different discrimination of motion by pigeons.
Year: 2023
Authors: Cook Robert G, Qadri Muhammad A J, Brooks Daniel I
Abstract: Telling that one object or moment is different from another one is fundamental to cognition and intelligent behavior. Most investigations examining same/different (S/D) concepts in animals have relied on testing static visual stimuli. To move beyond this limitation, we investigated how five pigeons learned and performed a motion S/D discrimination. Using a go/no-go task, dynamic motion fields built from dot elements were presented in sequence to display repeating (same) or changing (different) motions. Each trial consisted of 10 motion segments presented in succession using the direction and rate of dot movement in the motion field to exemplify the S/D relations. The pigeons learned this motion S/D discrimination. We further tested their performance by varying the number and persistence of the dots in the motion fields. The results indicated the pigeons likely extracted globally integrated perceptual summaries of the motions for comparison across the segments. Testing differing organizations of the S/D relations across segments indicated that this discrimination could be determined from as few as two segments and involved an updating comparison of at least four or more segments of the sequence during their presentation. Collectively, the experiments establish for the first time that pigeons can use motion features to classify sequential same and different experiences.

Title: [Patent application of intelligent quality control technology in traditional Chinese medicine production process: a review].
Year: 2023
Authors: Tang Xue-Fang, Qi Fei-Yu, Wang Tuan-Jie, Liang Zi-Chen, Qiao Yan-Jiang, Xiao Wei, Xu Bing
Abstract: In the new stage for intelligent manufacturing of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) from pilot demonstration to in-depth application and comprehensive promotion, how to raise the degree of intelligence for the process quality control system has become the bottleneck of the development of TCM production process control technology. This article has sorted out 226 TCM intelligent manufacturing projects that have been approved by the national and provincial governments since the implementation of the &quot;Made in China 2025&quot; plan and 145 related pharmaceutical enterprises. Then, the patents applied by these pharmaceutical enterprises were thoroughly retrieved, and 135 patents in terms of intelligent quality control technology in the production process were found. The technical details about intelligent quality control at both the unit levels such as cultivation, processing of crude herbs, preparation pretreatment, pharmaceutical preparations, and the production workshop level were reviewed from three aspects, i.e., intelligent quality sensing, intelligent process cognition, and intelligent process control. The results showed that intelligent quality control technologies have been preliminarily applied to the whole process of TCM production. The intelligence control of the extraction and concentration processes and the intelligent sensing of critical quality attributes are currently the focus of pharmaceutical enterprises. However, there is a lack of process cognitive patent technology for the TCM manufacturing process, which fails to meet the requirements of closed-loop integration of intelligent sensing and intelligent control technologies. It is suggested that in the future, with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, the process cognitive bottleneck of TCM production can be overcome, and the holistic quality formation mechanisms of TCM products can be elucidated. Moreover, key technologies for system integration and intelligent equipment are expected to be innovated and accelerated to enhance the quality uniformity and manufacturing reliability of TCM.

Authors: Huo Yiming, Lin Xingqin, Di Boya, Zhang Hongliang, Hernando Francisco Javier Lorca, Tan Ahmet Serdar, Mumtaz Shahid, Demir Özlem Tuğfe, Chen-Hu Kun
Abstract: At the dawn of the next-generation wireless systems and networks, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in combination with leading-edge technologies, methodologies, and architectures are poised to be a cornerstone technology. Capitalizing on its successful integration and scalability within 5G and beyond, massive MIMO has proven its merits and adaptability. Notably, a series of evolutionary advancements and revolutionary trends have begun to materialize in recent years, envisioned to redefine the landscape of future 6G wireless systems and networks. In particular, the capabilities and performance of future massive MIMO systems will be amplified through the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies, structures, and strategies. These include intelligent omni-surfaces (IOSs)/intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), artificial intelligence (AI), Terahertz (THz) communications, and cell-free architectures. In addition, an array of diverse applications built on the foundation of massive MIMO will continue to proliferate and thrive. These encompass wireless localization and sensing, vehicular communications, non-terrestrial communications, remote sensing, and inter-planetary communications, among others.

Title: Intelligent Manufacturing Technology in the Steel Industry of China: A Review.
Year: 2022
Authors: Zhou Dongdong, Xu Ke, Lv Zhimin, Yang Jianhong, Li Min, He Fei, Xu Gang
Abstract: Intelligent manufacturing, defined as the integration of manufacturing with modern information technologies such as 5G, digitalization, networking, and intelligence, has grown in popularity as a means of boosting the productivity, intelligence, and flexibility of traditional manufacturing processes. The steel industry is a necessary support for modern life and economic development, and the Chinese steel industry's capacity has expanded to roughly half of global production. However, the Chinese steel industry is now confronted with high labor costs, massive carbon emissions, a low level of intelligence, low production efficiency, and unstable quality control. Therefore, China's steel industry has launched several large-scale intelligent manufacturing initiatives to improve production efficiency, product quality, manual labor intensity, and employee working conditions. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive overview of intelligent manufacturing in China's steel industry. We began this research by summarizing the construction goals and overall framework for intelligent manufacturing of the steel industry in China. Following that, we offered a brief review of intelligent manufacturing for China's steel industry, as well as descriptions of two typical intelligent manufacturing models. Finally, some major technologies employed for intelligent production in China's steel industry were introduced. This research not only helps to comprehend the development model, essential technologies, and construction techniques of intelligent manufacturing in China's steel industry, but it also provides vital inspiration for the manufacturing industry's digital and intelligence updates and quality improvement.

Title: The joint influence of intelligence and practice on skill development throughout the life span.
Year: 2019
Authors: Vaci Nemanja, Edelsbrunner Peter, Stern Elsbeth, Neubauer Aljoscha, Bilalić Merim, Grabner Roland H
Abstract: The relative importance of different factors in the development of human skills has been extensively discussed. Research on expertise indicates that focused practice may be the sole determinant of skill, while intelligence researchers underline the relative importance of abilities at even the highest level of skill. There is indeed a large body of research that acknowledges the role of both factors in skill development and retention. It is, however, unknown how intelligence and practice come together to enable the acquisition and retention of complex skills across the life span. Instead of focusing on the 2 factors, intelligence and practice, in isolation, here we look at their interplay throughout development. In a longitudinal study that tracked chess players throughout their careers, we show that both intelligence and practice positively affect the acquisition and retention of chess skill. Importantly, the nonlinear interaction between the 2 factors revealed that more intelligent individuals benefited more from practice. With the same amount of practice, they acquired chess skill more quickly than less intelligent players, reached a higher peak performance, and arrested decline in older age. Our research demonstrates the futility of scrutinizing the relative importance of highly intertwined factors in human development.

Title: Infrastructural intelligence: Contemporary entanglements between neuroscience and AI.
Year: 2017
Authors: Bruder Johannes
Abstract: In this chapter, I reflect on contemporary entanglements between artificial intelligence and the neurosciences by tracing the development of Google's recent DeepMind algorithms back to their roots in neuroscientific studies of episodic memory and imagination. Google promotes a new form of "infrastructural intelligence," which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.

Title: Fluid intelligence and executive functioning more alike than different?
Year: 2016
Authors: van Aken Loes, Kessels Roy P C, Wingbermühle Ellen, van der Veld William M, Egger Jos I M
Abstract: Fluid intelligence (Gf) has been related to executive functioning (EF) in previous studies, and it is also known to be correlated with crystallized intelligence (Gc). The present study includes representative measures of Gf, Gc, and EF frequently used in clinical practice to examine this Gf-EF relation. It is hypothesised that the Gf-EF relation is higher than the Gc-EF relation, and that working memory in particular (as a measure of EF) shows a high contribution to this relation.

Title: Dispositional Empathy and Emotional Intelligence in terms of Perfectionistic Automatic Thoughts.
Year: 2021
Authors: Aparicio-Flores María Pilar, Esteve-Faubel José María, Vicent María, Gonzálvez Carolina, Sanmartín Ricardo, García-Fernández José Manuel
Abstract: The maladaptive nature of Perfectionistic Automatic Thoughts (PAT) increases the importance of evaluating the construct. This study aims to identify different clusters of PAT in undergraduates, and to check possible inter-cluster differences in the dimensions of dispositional empathy and emotional intelligence in a sample of 691 Spanish undergraduates (Mage = 23.1; SD = 5.26). The Perfectionism Cognitions Inventory, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale were used. Three clusters with low (LPAT), moderate (MPAT) and high (HPAT) levels of PAT were identified. Statistically significant differences were observed between these clusters in terms of dispositional empathy and emotional intelligence dimensions. HPAT significantly scored higher than LPAT on Fantasy, Empathic Concern, Personal Discomfort and Perception, as well as in comparison with MPAT on Fantasy, Empathic Concern, Personal Discomfort and Perception. Moreover, MPAT obtained significantly higher scores on Comprehension and Repair than LPAT. Effect sizes for these differences were of a small magnitude, except for the HPAT and LPAT contrasts, whose differences were of a moderate magnitude.

Title: Integrating Engineering, Automation, and Intelligence to Catalyze the Biomedical Translation of Organoids.
Year: 2021
Authors: Ma Shaohua, Zhao Haoran, Galan Edgar A
Abstract: Organoid technology has developed at an impressive speed during the past decade. Still, organoids are not widely used in practical applications as expected. It is believed that this translation can be greatly accelerated with the integration of engineering and artificial intelligence into current research practices. It is proposed that this approach is the missing link to realize key milestones in organoid technology, namely, high-throughput, homogeneous, and standardized production, automated manipulation, and intelligent monitoring, evaluation, and control via integrated on-chip instrumentation and artificial intelligence. It is suggested that organoids-on-a-chip are the ideal platform to achieve these feats. Once these techniques are established and adopted by the scientific community, the rapid translation of organoids may be seen from laboratories to the clinics and pharmaceutical industry.

Title: A Review of Manufacturing Methods for Flexible Devices and Energy Storage Devices.
Year: 2023
Authors: Han Yuntao, Cui Yunwei, Liu Xuxian, Wang Yaqun
Abstract: Given the advancements in modern living standards and technological development, conventional smart devices have proven inadequate in meeting the demands for a high-quality lifestyle. Therefore, a revolution is necessary to overcome this impasse and facilitate the emergence of flexible electronics. Specifically, there is a growing focus on health detection, necessitating advanced flexible preparation technology for biosensor-based smart wearable devices. Nowadays, numerous flexible products are available on the market, such as electronic devices with flexible connections, bendable LED light arrays, and flexible radio frequency electronic tags for storing information. The manufacturing process of these devices is relatively straightforward, and their integration is uncomplicated. However, their functionality remains limited. Further research is necessary for the development of more intricate applications, such as intelligent wearables and energy storage systems. Taking smart wear as an example, it is worth noting that the current mainstream products on the market primarily consist of bracelet-type health testing equipment. They exhibit limited flexibility and can only be worn on the wrist for measurement purposes, which greatly limits their application diversity. Flexible energy storage and flexible display also face the same problem, so there is still a lot of room for development in the field of flexible electronics manufacturing. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the developmental history of flexible devices, systematically summarizing representative preparation methods and typical applications, identifying challenges, proposing solutions, and offering prospects for future development.

Title: Strong genetic overlap between executive functions and intelligence.
Year: 2016
Authors: Engelhardt Laura E, Mann Frank D, Briley Daniel A, Church Jessica A, Harden K Paige, Tucker-Drob Elliot M
Abstract: Executive functions (EFs) are cognitive processes that control, monitor, and coordinate more basic cognitive processes. EFs play instrumental roles in models of complex reasoning, learning, and decision making, and individual differences in EFs have been consistently linked with individual differences in intelligence. By middle childhood, genetic factors account for a moderate proportion of the variance in intelligence, and these effects increase in magnitude through adolescence. Genetic influences on EFs are very high, even in middle childhood, but the extent to which these genetic influences overlap with those on intelligence is unclear. We examined genetic and environmental overlap between EFs and intelligence in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of 811 twins ages 7 to 15 years (M = 10.91, SD = 1.74) from the Texas Twin Project. A general EF factor representing variance common to inhibition, switching, working memory, and updating domains accounted for substantial proportions of variance in intelligence, primarily via a genetic pathway. General EF continued to have a strong, genetically mediated association with intelligence even after controlling for processing speed. Residual variation in general intelligence was influenced only by shared and nonshared environmental factors, and there remained no genetic variance in general intelligence that was unique of EF. Genetic variance independent of EF did remain, however, in a more specific perceptual reasoning ability. These results provide evidence that genetic influences on general intelligence are highly overlapping with those on EF. (PsycINFO Database Record

Title: The relationship between chronotype and intelligence: the importance of work timing.
Year: 2020
Authors: Ujma Péter P, Baudson Tanja G, Bódizs Róbert, Dresler Martin
Abstract: Sleep-wake patterns show substantial biological determination, but they are also subject to individual choice and societal pressure. Some evidence suggests that high IQ is associated with later sleep patterns. However, it is unclear whether the relationship between IQ and later sleep is due to biological or social effects, such as the timing of working hours. We investigated the association between habitual sleep timing during work days and work-free days, working time and membership in Mensa, an organization of highly intelligent individuals (IQ  ≥130) using a sample of 1,172 adults split between Mensa members and age- and sex-matched volunteers from a large web-based database. We found no difference in chronotype, and the later sleep timing of Mensa members on work days was fully accounted for by later work start times. Our results indicate that later sleep timing in those with higher IQs is not due to physiological differences, but rather due to later work schedules. Later working times and the resulting lower social jetlag may be one of the reasons why higher IQ is associated with lower prospective morbidity and mortality.

Title: The Interplay Between Cognitive Intelligence, Ability Emotional Intelligence, and Religiosity.
Year: 2020
Authors: Łowicki Paweł, Zajenkowski Marcin, van der Linden Dimitri
Abstract: The negative association between cognitive intelligence (CI) and religiosity has been widely studied and is now well documented. In contrast, the role of emotional intelligence (EI) in this context has been poorly investigated thus far. Some available data indicate that EI, unlike CI, correlates positively with religiosity. To date, however, no study has explored the relationship between religiosity and both intelligences simultaneously. In current studies (Ns = 301 and 200), we examined the interplay between all three constructs. The results showed that CI was positively correlated with ability EI and negatively with some measures of religiosity. EI, on the other hand, revealed no direct, significant relationship with religiosity. However, when combined into a single regression model with CI, EI became a significant positive predictor of religiosity. Moreover, Study 2 revealed that the link between EI and religiosity was mediated by empathy. Interestingly, we also found a reciprocal suppression between CI and EI, since both predictors increased their influence on religiosity when analyzed together. Although the suppression was present in both studies, it was observed for different religiosity measures in each case, indicating that this effect is probably dependent on various factors, such as sample structure or type of religiosity.

Title: Development of a Cultural Intelligence Framework in Pharmacy Education.
Year: 2021
Authors: Minshew Lana M, Lee Diana, White Carla Y, McClurg Mary, McLaughlin Jacqueline E
Abstract: <b>Objective.</b> Pharmacists must be equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to provide culturally intelligent and patient-centered care; however, most are not trained to do so. In order to prepare culturally intelligent pharmacists, standards and curricula for cultural intelligence must be defined and implemented within pharmacy education. The objective of this study was to create a cultural intelligence framework (CIF) for pharmacy education and determine its alignment with Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) training.<b>Methods.</b> An extensive literature analysis on current methods of cultural intelligence education was used to construct a CIF, which integrates leading models of cultural intelligence in health care education with Bloom's Taxonomy. Five student focus groups were conducted to explore and map their cultural experiences to the CIF. All focus groups were recorded, transcribed, deidentified and deductively coded using the CIF.<b>Results.</b> The four CIF domains (awareness, knowledge, practice, desire) were observed in all five focus groups; however, not every participant expressed each domain when sharing their experiences. Most students expressed cultural awareness, knowledge, and desire, however, only a few students discussed cultural practice. Participant comments regarding their experiences differed by race and year in the curriculum.<b>Conclusion.</b> This study was a first step toward understanding cultural intelligence education and experiences in pharmacy. The CIF represents an evidence-based approach to cultural intelligence training that can help prepare pharmacy learners to be socially responsible health care practitioners.

Title: Design and Implementation of Interactive Platform for Operation and Maintenance of Multimedia Information System Based on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data.
Year: 2022
Authors: Yan Xin, Yan Junhui
Abstract: In order to cope with the challenges that operators face after the impact of diversified social channels in the field of interactive services, we actively build a new generation of intelligent interactive systems based on artificial intelligence technology, a semantic understanding, and intention recognition, covering rich media content, omnichannel coverage, high-frequency knowledge updates, consistent service response, high-quality, and low-cost intelligent interactive solutions is proposed. The solution provides overall business modeling for scenario design and a scenario-based knowledge expression system, with the function of fragmented knowledge processing. With complete text and voice information, combined with pictures, text, audio, video, and other multimedia, we intelligently interact with users, allowing users to obtain required information and solve problems in a pleasant and relaxing interaction. Therefore, the research and exploration of the intelligent interactive system architecture based on artificial intelligence is a useful practice and strong support for operators to redefine the connotation and elements of "smart service" in the process of building "smart operation." Through repeated tests, it can be seen that the language similarity has reached 0.75549, which is very close to 1.0000. It can be seen that the design of this platform has been successful.

Title: Theory of Mind and diverse intelligences in 4-year-olds: Modelling associations of false beliefs with children's numerate-spatial, verbal, and social intelligence.
Year: 2020
Authors: Osterhaus Christopher, Putnick Diane L, Kristen-Antonow Susanne, Kloo Daniela, Bornstein Marc H, Sodian Beate
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) and the structure of intelligence were investigated in 115 4-year-olds. Specifically, we asked whether children's intelligence involves both general and specific aspects and whether standard ToM measures of false belief can serve as indicators of social intelligence. Psychometric intelligence and children's domain-specific understanding of number concepts and of mental states (false belief) were measured in the laboratory; communication and social skills were assessed through mothers' report. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed poor fit for a one-factor model, but good fit for a model with three correlated factors, suggesting that children's intelligence involves both general and specific aspects. Numerate-spatial and verbal intelligence were correlated (.70), and social intelligence correlated to a stronger degree with verbal (.66) than with numerate-spatial intelligence (.37). Laboratory assessment of false belief and mothers' reports about children's social skills loaded on a single factor, pointing to real-world consequences of ToM abilities. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The structure of intelligence in 4-year-olds comprises domain-general and domain-specific dimensions. Some domain-specific dimensions are numerate-spatial, verbal, and social intelligence. What does this study add? Theory of Mind emerges as an aspect of children's social intelligence. Social intelligence (including Theory of Mind) is related to children's numerate-spatial abilities.

Title: Effects of an 8-Week Cooperative Learning Intervention on Physical Education Students' Task and Self-Approach Goals, and Emotional Intelligence.
Year: 2020
Authors: Rivera-Pérez Sergio, Fernandez-Rio Javier, Iglesias Gallego Damián
Abstract: Previous research highlighted the effectiveness of cooperative learning in the four learning domains: physical, cognitive, social and affective. However, recent reviews have called for more empirical research on social and emotional learning based on contemporary theories, frameworks and assessment tools. Little is known about the links between cooperative learning and two strong contemporary frameworks: the achievement goal theory and the four-branch model of emotional intelligence. The goal of this study was to assess the connections between cooperative learning, task and self-approach goals, and emotional intelligence in physical education classes. Forty primary education students (21 girls, 19 boys), 10-12 years (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 10.87; <i>SD</i> = 0.85), enrolled in two different classes in only one school, participated. None of them had experienced cooperative learning as a pedagogical model before. The study followed a one group, pre-test-post-test, pre-experimental design. Both classes experienced the same cooperative learning intervention programme conducted in physical education, which included two consecutive learning units for a total of 16 sessions (2 per week/50 min each). The same physical education teacher, an expert in cooperative learning, conducted all sessions. Results showed that the cooperative learning framework helped increase students' self-approach goals and their emotional control and regulation, and empathy. In conclusion, the present study reinforced the use of cooperative learning in physical education, because it can guide students to more adaptive motivational patterns and to develop their emotional intelligence. Furthermore, it contributes to the students' social and emotional learning building quality relationships, learning to manage stressors, and evolve individually and in groups.

Title: Comparing artificial intelligence and human coaching goal attainment efficacy.
Year: 2022
Authors: Terblanche Nicky, Molyn Joanna, de Haan Erik, Nilsson Viktor O
Abstract: The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is filled with hype and inflated expectations. Notwithstanding, AI is finding its way into numerous aspects of humanity including the fast-growing helping profession of coaching. Coaching has been shown to be efficacious in a variety of human development facets. The application of AI in a narrow, specific area of coaching has also been shown to work. What remains uncertain, is how the two compare. In this paper we compare two equivalent longitudinal randomised control trial studies that measured the increase in clients' goal attainment as a result of having received coaching over a 10-month period. The first study involved human coaches and the replication study used an AI chatbot coach. In both studies, human coaches and the AI coach were significantly more effective in helping clients reach their goals compared to the two control groups. Surprisingly however, the AI coach was as effective as human coaches at the end of the trials. We interpret this result using AI and goal theory and present three significant implications: AI coaching could be scaled to democratize coaching; AI coaching could grow the demand for human coaching; and AI could replace human coaches who use simplistic, model-based coaching approaches. At present, AI's lack of empathy and emotional intelligence make human coaches irreplicable. However, understanding the efficacy of AI coaching relative to human coaching may promote the focused use of AI, to the significant benefit of society.

Title: Swarm intelligence in fish? The difficulty in demonstrating distributed and self-organised collective intelligence in (some) animal groups.
Year: 2017
Authors: Ioannou Christos C
Abstract: Larger groups often have a greater ability to solve cognitive tasks compared to smaller ones or lone individuals. This is well established in social insects, navigating flocks of birds, and in groups of prey collectively vigilant for predators. Research in social insects has convincingly shown that improved cognitive performance can arise from self-organised local interactions between individuals that integrates their contributions, often referred to as swarm intelligence. This emergent collective intelligence has gained in popularity and been directly applied to groups of other animals, including fish. Despite being a likely mechanism at least partially explaining group performance in vertebrates, I argue here that other possible explanations are rarely ruled out in empirical studies. Hence, evidence for self-organised collective (or 'swarm') intelligence in fish is not as strong as it would first appear. These other explanations, the 'pool-of-competence' and the greater cognitive ability of individuals when in larger groups, are also reviewed. Also discussed is why improved group performance in general may be less often observed in animals such as shoaling fish compared to social insects. This review intends to highlight the difficulties in exploring collective intelligence in animal groups, ideally leading to further empirical work to illuminate these issues.

Title: Rationality as the end of thought.
Year: 2022
Authors: Chater Nick
Abstract: Bermúdez convincingly argues that framing effects are ubiquitous and that this is not a sign of human irrationality, but an unavoidable feature of any intelligent system. The commentary adds that framing effects arise even in formal domains, such as chess and mathematics, which appear paradigms of rational thought. Indeed, finding and attempting to resolve clashes between different frames is a major impetus for deliberative cognition.

Title: A Review of Intelligent Driving Pedestrian Detection Based on Deep Learning.
Year: 2021
Authors: Tian Di, Han Yi, Wang Biyao, Guan Tian, Wei Wei
Abstract: Pedestrian detection is a specific application of object detection. Compared with general object detection, it shows similarities and unique characteristics. In addition, it has important application value in the fields of intelligent driving and security monitoring. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, pedestrian detection technology has also made great progress. However, there still exists a huge gap between it and human perception. Meanwhile, there are still a lot of problems, and there remains a lot of room for research. Regarding the application of pedestrian detection in intelligent driving technology, it is of necessity to ensure its real-time performance. Additionally, it is necessary to lighten the model while ensuring detection accuracy. This paper first briefly describes the development process of pedestrian detection and then concentrates on summarizing the research results of pedestrian detection technology in the deep learning stage. Subsequently, by summarizing the pedestrian detection dataset and evaluation criteria, the core issues of the current development of pedestrian detection are analyzed. Finally, the next possible development direction of pedestrian detection technology is explained at the end of the paper.

Title: Cognitive profile and academic achievement of children with absence epilepsy.
Year: 2019
Authors: Yıldız-Çoksan Serpil, Aslan Aslı, Çoksan Sami, Okuyaz Çetin
Abstract: The main aim of this study was to examine the cognitive profile and academic achievement of children with absence epilepsy. It is investigated whether all scale intelligence score, intelligence subscale scores, and academic achievement of the children with absence epilepsy differed from healthy peers and Turkish norm values. Nineteen children with absence epilepsy and 19 healthy children participate in the study. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) is used to measure their intelligence scores. A teacher assessment form (Teacher's Report Form (TRF)) is obtained from the participants' teachers for the measurement of academic achievement, and the students' report cards are collected as an additional measure of it. Participants with absence epilepsy have significantly lower scores of total intelligence score (Mean (M) = 76.68, Standard Deviation (SD) = 25.18), verbal comprehension score (M = 81.68, SD = 25.29), perceptual reasoning score (M = 85.47, SD = 20.61), processing speed score (M = 77.95, SD = 18.61), and working memory (M = 83.74, SD = 19.04), which are measured by WISC-IV, than healthy peers (respectively M = 105.84, SD = 16.20; M = 105.47, SD = 18.12; M = 103.63, SD = 12.88; M = 104.05, SD = 12.98; M = 104.74, SD = 18.97) and norm values (M = 100, SD = 10). No difference is observed between the subscale scores of WISC-IV for within group with absence epilepsy. Moreover, they have lower Turkish language (M = 73.65, SD = 19.19) and mathematics (M = 76.26, SD = 22.29) grade report scores than healthy peers (respectively M = 90.76, SD = 12.01; M = 88.64, SD = 15.93). There is no difference between the two groups in terms of the academic achievement obtained from the TRF. It is necessary to support children with absence epilepsy academically. We analyzed whether the current pattern has changed by comparing the intelligent scores and academic achievement of children with absence epilepsy who have recovered after treatment with their healthy peers. In fact, there is no difference between the children with absence epilepsy who have recovered after treatment and their healthy peers in terms of total intelligence score and its subscale scores. Similarly, there is no difference between them in terms of mathematics score on their report. Only the difference in the score of Turkish language continues in the same direction.

Title: The influence of chronotype and intelligence on academic achievement in primary school is mediated by conscientiousness, midpoint of sleep and motivation.
Year: 2015
Authors: Arbabi Talat, Vollmer Christian, Dörfler Tobias, Randler Christoph
Abstract: Individuals differ in their timing of sleep (bed times, rise times) and in their preference for morning or evening hours. Previous work focused on the relationship between academic achievement and these variables in secondary school students. The main aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between chronotype and academic achievement in 10-year-old children (n = 1125) attending 4th grade of primary school. They filled a cognitive test (Culture Fair Intelligence Test, CFT 20-R) and questions about rise times and bed times, academic achievement, conscientiousness and motivation. We used the "scales for the assessment of learning and performance motivation" (SELLMO; Skalen zur Erfassung der Lern- und Leistungsmotivation for motivation), the short version of the Five-Factor Personality Inventory Children (FFPI-C) to measure conscientiousness, and the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) to assess morningness-eveningness. Mean CSM score was 37.84 ± 6.66, midpoint of sleep was 1:36 ± 00:25 and average sleep duration (time in bed) was 10:15 ± 0:48. Morningness orientation was positively related to intelligence, conscientiousness and learning objectives. Eveningness orientation was related to avoidance performance objectives and work avoidance. Early midpoint of sleep, conscientiousness and intelligence were associated with better grades. The multivariate model showed that intelligence was the strongest predictor of good grades. Conscientiousness, motivation, younger age and an earlier midpoint of sleep were positively related to good grades. This is the first study in primary school pupils, and it shows that the relationship between evening orientation and academic achievement is already prevalent at this age even when controlling for important predictors of achievement.

Title: Exploration of the intelligent control system of autonomous vehicles based on edge computing.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ming Guo
Abstract: The development of science and technology continues to promote the progress of society. The current intelligence and automation technology has become widely used in society. To this end, this study proposes a vehicle intelligent control system based on edge computing and deep learning to promote the far-reaching development of intelligent technology and automation technology. First, control algorithms are used to design a switch control strategy combining accelerator and brake. Second, a fuzzy control algorithm based on vehicle tracking and trajectory deviation is designed to enhance the vehicle's stability during steering. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to recognize the car's surroundings as it drives. In addition, accelerator and brake controllers and vehicle tracking and trajectory deviation controllers are connected to the vehicle's wiring. Then, the data transmission function based on edge computing is applied to the vehicle's intelligent control system. Finally, trajectory tracking and emergency braking experiments are carried out on the control system to verify the practicability and reliability of the method and the effectiveness of CNN. The simulation experiments are carried out on two states of medium speed and high speed to verify the effectiveness of the longitudinal anti-collision system of the test vehicle when the target vehicle suddenly decelerates. The results demonstrate that the driving speed of the experimental vehicle is set to 50km/h, the distance between the experimental vehicle and the target vehicle is 40m, and the target vehicle in front drives at a constant speed of 50km/h. The target vehicle in front of the car suddenly decelerates in 5 seconds, and the speed drops to 0 after 5 seconds. The actual distance between the experimental vehicle and the target vehicle is very close to the expected safe space, and the experimental vehicle is in a safe state during this process. When the experimental vehicle starts to decelerate, the experimental vehicle adopts emergency deceleration to ensure a safe distance between the two vehicles. At this time, the car enters the second-level early warning state, but driving safety can still be guaranteed. It is advisable to maintain low-speed emergency braking in this state. This study provides creative research ideas for the follow-up research on the intelligent control system of uncrewed vehicles and contributes to the development of intelligence and automation technology.

Title: Relationship between self-compassion and emotional intelligence in nursing students.
Year: 2014
Authors: Şenyuva Emine, Kaya Hülya, Işik Burçin, Bodur Gönül
Abstract: Nursing focuses on meeting physical, social and emotional health-care needs of individuals, families and society. In health care, nurses directly communicate with patients and try to empathize with them. Nurses give care under emotionally intense conditions where the individual undergoes pain and distress. Research is aimed at analysing the correlation of self-compassion and emotional intelligence of nursing students. The population of the research consisted of all the undergraduate students (571 students) of the 2010-2011 fall semester of the department of nursing. An information form, Self-compassion Scale and Emotional Intelligence Assessment Scale were utilized to obtain data for the research. For the assessment of the findings of research, Statistical Package for Social Sciences 16.0 for Windows was utilized for statistical analysis. Results indicated that there is a correlation between self-compassion and emotional intelligence and that emotional intelligence, which includes the individual perceiving one's emotions and using the knowledge one gained from them to function while directing thoughts, actions and professional applications, has positive contributions to the features of nurses with developed self-compassion.

Title: Incentivizing free riders improves collective intelligence in social dilemmas.
Year: 2023
Authors: Tchernichovski Ofer, Frey Seth, Jacoby Nori, Conley Dalton
Abstract: Collective intelligence challenges are often entangled with collective action problems. For example, voting, rating, and social innovation are collective intelligence tasks that require costly individual contributions. As a result, members of a group often free ride on the information contributed by intrinsically motivated people. Are intrinsically motivated agents the best participants in collective decisions? We embedded a collective intelligence task in a large-scale, virtual world public good game and found that participants who joined the information system but were reluctant to contribute to the public good (free riders) provided more accurate evaluations, whereas participants who rated frequently underperformed. Testing the underlying mechanism revealed that a negative rating bias in free riders is associated with higher accuracy. Importantly, incentivizing evaluations amplifies the relative influence of participants who tend to free ride without altering the (higher) quality of their evaluations, thereby improving collective intelligence. These results suggest that many of the currently available information systems, which strongly select for intrinsically motivated participants, underperform and that collective intelligence can benefit from incentivizing free riding members to engage. More generally, enhancing the diversity of contributor motivations can improve collective intelligence in settings that are entangled with collective action problems.

Title: Emotional intelligence and its role in recruitment of nursing students.
Year: 
Authors: Lyon Steven Robert, Trotter Fiona, Holt Barrie, Powell Elaine, Roe Andrew
Abstract: This article considers the concept of emotional intelligence and how it can be used in the recruitment and development of nursing students. The links between emotional intelligence and the qualities of compassion and caring are examined. The ethical difficulties surrounding the use of emotional intelligence tests are explored and the value of using a variety of recruitment methods is emphasised. The article suggests that emotional intelligence is an ability which may be developed through nurse education programmes, even if not fully present at interview. The contribution of service users to the recruitment of nursing students is examined, suggesting that they offer some important observations about interviewees. These observations may be more valid than the insights gained from the use of emotional intelligence tests.

Title: Artificial Collective Intelligence Engineering: A Survey of Concepts and Perspectives.
Year: 2023
Authors: Casadei Roberto
Abstract: Collectiveness is an important property of many systems-both natural and artificial. By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals or even to produce intelligent collective behavior out of not-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely, the capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems-motivated by recent technoscientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, to name only a few. For several years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognized research topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains. However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this gap, this article considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts, and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering.

Title: Evolutionary epistemology: Reviewing and reviving with new data the research programme for distributed biological intelligence.
Year: 2018
Authors: Slijepcevic Predrag
Abstract: Numerous studies in microbiology, eukaryotic cell biology, plant biology, biomimetics, synthetic biology, and philosophy of science appear to support the principles of the epistemological theory inspired by evolution, also known as "Evolutionary Epistemology", or EE. However, that none of the studies acknowledged EE suggests that its principles have not been formulated with sufficient clarity and depth to resonate with the interests of the empirical research community. In this paper I review evidence in favor of EE, and also reformulate EE principles to better inform future research. The revamped programme may be tentatively called Research Programme for Distributed Biological Intelligence. Intelligence I define as the capacity of organisms to gain information about their environment, process that information internally, and translate it into phenotypic forms. This multistage progression may be expressed through the acronym IGPT (information-gain-process-translate). The key principles of the programme may be summarized as follows. (i) Intelligence, a universal biological phenomenon promoting individual fitness, is required for effective organism-environment interactions. Given that animals represent less than 0.01% of the planetary biomass, neural intelligence is not the evolutionary norm. (ii) The basic unit of intelligence is a single cell prokaryote. All other forms of intelligence are derived. (iii) Intelligence is hierarchical. It ranges from bacteria to the biosphere or Gaia. (iv) The concept of "information" acquires a new meaning because information processing is at the heart of biological intelligence. All biological systems, from bacteria to Gaia, are intelligent, open thermodynamic systems that exchange information, matter and energy with the environment. (v) The organism-environment interaction is cybernetic. As much as the organism changes due to the influence of the environment, the organism's responses to induced changes affect the environment and subsequent organism-environment interactions. Based on the above principles a new research agenda can be formulated to explore different forms of biological intelligence.

Title: Holistic Security and Safety for Factories of the Future.
Year: 2022
Authors: Maia Eva, Wannous Sinan, Dias Tiago, Praça Isabel, Faria Ana
Abstract: The accelerating transition of traditional industrial processes towards fully automated and intelligent manufacturing is being witnessed in almost all segments. This major adoption of enhanced technology and digitization processes has been originally embraced by the Factories of the Future and Industry 4.0 initiatives. The overall aim is to create smarter, more sustainable, and more resilient future-oriented factories. Unsurprisingly, introducing new production paradigms based on technologies such as machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics does not come at no cost as each newly incorporated technique poses various safety and security challenges. Similarly, the integration required between these techniques to establish a unified and fully interconnected environment contributes to additional threats and risks in the Factories of the Future. Accumulating and analyzing seemingly unrelated activities, occurring simultaneously in different parts of the factory, is essential to establish cyber situational awareness of the investigated environment. Our work contributes to these efforts, in essence by envisioning and implementing the SMS-DT, an integrated platform to simulate and monitor industrial conditions in a digital twin-based architecture. SMS-DT is represented in a three-tier architecture comprising the involved data and control flows: edge, platform, and enterprise tiers. The goal of our platform is to capture, analyze, and correlate a wide range of events being tracked by sensors and systems in various domains of the factory. For this aim, multiple components have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence to simulate dominant aspects in industries, including network analysis, energy optimization, and worker behavior. A data lake was also used to store collected information, and a set of intelligent services was delivered on the basis of innovative analysis and learning approaches. Finally, the platform was tested in a textile industry environment and integrated with its ERP system. Two misuse cases were simulated to track the factory machines, systems, and people and to assess the role of SMS-DT correlation mechanisms in preventing intentional and unintentional actions. The results of these misuse case simulations showed how the SMS-DT platform can intervene in two domains in the first scenario and three in the second one, resulting in correlating the alerts and reporting them to security operators in the multi-domain intelligent correlation dashboard.

Title: [Artificial intelligence, the future of intelligence or the intelligence of the future?].
Year: 2020
Authors: Philibert Aymeric
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) consists of setting different technics together aimed at allowing machines to simulate human cognitive fonctions, mimic human brain functions, sometime its logic, when it comes to answer to an interrogation, to take decisions or to anticipate events. This new fonction, after being used in numerous daily life domains (geo-guides, personal assistants, administratif procedures) comes now in the medical area. The press exaggerations on those systems doesn't have any wise and thoughtful judgment. This article will talk about the question of the real uses and expertise capacities which the AI should be able to provide in our area. Through the history of cognitive science and ideas, the recension of important works on the AI developments, we want to put in perspective the promises and opportunities provided to modify or complete the expertise in orthodontics. The willingness to extend cognitive and action abilities is older than what the comma historiography of the AI let us think. The recent development of computer systems, algorithmic science and databases allowed the development of a branch of the artificial intelligent giving, in some cases, seemingly undeniable results which should not be extrapolated because of the weakness of our databases, the current economic model and their real use.

Title: PSO Algorithm-Based Design of Intelligent Education Personalization System.
Year: 2022
Authors: Li Pengjiao, Yang Jun
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence in the field of education is becoming more and more extensive and in-depth. The intelligent education system can not only solve the limitations of location, time, and resources in the traditional learning field but it can also provide learners with a convenient, real-time, and interactive learning environment and has become one of the important applications in the Internet field. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence-enabled stochastic optimization scheme. It is derived from a model of bird population foraging behavior. Because of its benefits of ease of implementation, high accuracy, and quick convergence, this algorithm has gained the attention of academics, and it has demonstrated its supremacy in addressing real issues. This paper aims to study the optimization of PSO in the field of computational intelligence, improve the matching degree of learning resource recommendation and learning path optimization, and improve the learning efficiency of online learners. This paper suggests intelligent education as the center, takes the PSO algorithm as the main research object, and expounds the related concepts of intelligent education and PSO algorithm. It uses swarm intelligence algorithms for intelligent education personalized services. He focuses on PSO algorithm and its work in intelligent education recommendation and learning path planning. Experiments show that the average value of the difference between the two obtained by the NBPSO algorithm is 1.13<i>E</i> + 02 and the variance 1.88<i>E</i> + 02 is the smallest. Therefore, PSO aids in improving the quality and consistency of online course resource development. In conclusion, the research results of this paper further demonstrate the advantages of PSO algorithm in solving the problem of personalized service in intelligent education. It can promote the in-depth application of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms in intelligent online learning systems. This effectively enhances the intelligent service level of the online learning system and increases the efficiency of online learning.

Title: Bullshit Ability as an Honest Signal of Intelligence.
Year: 2021
Authors: Turpin Martin Harry, Kara-Yakoubian Mane, Walker Alexander C, Walker Heather E K, Fugelsang Jonathan A, Stolz Jennifer A
Abstract: Navigating social systems efficiently is critical to our species. Humans appear endowed with a cognitive system that has formed to meet the unique challenges that emerge for highly social species. Bullshitting, communication characterised by an intent to be convincing or impressive without concern for truth, is ubiquitous within human societies. Across two studies (<i>N</i> = 1,017), we assess participants' ability to produce satisfying and seemingly accurate bullshit as an honest signal of their intelligence. We find that bullshit ability is associated with an individual's intelligence and individuals capable of producing more satisfying bullshit are judged by second-hand observers to be more intelligent. We interpret these results as adding evidence for intelligence being geared towards the navigation of social systems. The ability to produce satisfying bullshit may serve to assist individuals in negotiating their social world, both as an energetically efficient strategy for impressing others and as an honest signal of intelligence.

Title: Emotional intelligence and mismatching expressive and verbal messages: a contribution to detection of deception.
Year: 2014
Authors: Wojciechowski Jerzy, Stolarski Maciej, Matthews Gerald
Abstract: Processing facial emotion, especially mismatches between facial and verbal messages, is believed to be important in the detection of deception. For example, emotional leakage may accompany lying. Individuals with superior emotion perception abilities may then be more adept in detecting deception by identifying mismatch between facial and verbal messages. Two personal factors that may predict such abilities are female gender and high emotional intelligence (EI). However, evidence on the role of gender and EI in detection of deception is mixed. A key issue is that the facial processing skills required to detect deception may not be the same as those required to identify facial emotion. To test this possibility, we developed a novel facial processing task, the FDT (Face Decoding Test) that requires detection of inconsistencies between facial and verbal cues to emotion. We hypothesized that gender and ability EI would be related to performance when cues were inconsistent. We also hypothesized that gender effects would be mediated by EI, because women tend to score as more emotionally intelligent on ability tests. Data were collected from 210 participants. Analyses of the FDT suggested that EI was correlated with superior face decoding in all conditions. We also confirmed the expected gender difference, the superiority of high EI individuals, and the mediation hypothesis. Also, EI was more strongly associated with facial decoding performance in women than in men, implying there may be gender differences in strategies for processing affective cues. It is concluded that integration of emotional and cognitive cues may be a core attribute of EI that contributes to the detection of deception.

Title: Are emotional intelligent workers also more empathic?
Year: 2013
Authors: Martos Maria Pilar Berrios, Lopez-Zafra Esther, Pulido-Martos Manuel, Augusto José María
Abstract: This paper analyzes whether emotional intelligence and self-monitoring are related to empathy among a sample of workers in both the public and private employment sectors. Two hundred and forty-two employees (42.5% men and 57.5% women) with a mean age of 35.21 years (SD = 10.07, range 18-61) completed a questionnaire that measured the variables of interest. The results showed that emotion regulation, a dimension of emotional intelligence, accounts for most of the variance of empathy, followed by the ability to understand emotions and the management of others' emotions. Furthermore, gender did not yield any moderator effect on the relations among emotional intelligence, self-monitoring and empathy. We conclude that the intrapersonal aspects of emotional intelligence, in particular, emotion regulation, help explain the empathy of workers. The implications of these findings are discussed herein.

Title: Feasibility and Safety of Mesocolon Excision with Medical Imaging: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Chengkui, Zhao Qiang, Song Zhichao
Abstract: The development of new technologies based on electronic intelligent images is a very active research and promotion of new technologies in recent years. This article mainly summarizes the basic concept, development, and technology of electronic intelligent imaging technology, as well as the research, promotion, and application of electronic intelligent imaging technology in clinical treatment. It especially emphasizes the practicality and application of electronic intelligent imaging technology in the current clinical operation process and conducts a meta-analysis of the current mesorectal excision, so as to provide more scientific and professional guidance for clinical surgery. The results of the meta-analysis showed that 3291 documents were initially obtained and duplicate documents were deleted by searching for keywords in mesocolon excision. We excluded 2399 subjects and articles whose interventions did not meet the inclusion criteria of this study after reading the title and abstract. Then, we obtained 892 papers that may meet the inclusion criteria through preliminary screening. We further optimized the search strategy based on selection criteria and data integrity filtering principles and finally determined 111 references. 100 articles that did not meet the requirements were excluded, and 11 articles were finally included for meta-analysis. Medical imaging can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of mesocolon excision and reduce the occurrence of complications. Therefore, it is very important to combine medical intelligent images for preoperative evaluation, and the development of the combination of surgical treatment and medical images should not be underestimated in the future.

Title: "Entrepreneurship" from the lens of enlightenment: Impacts of religiosity and spiritual intelligence on social entrepreneurial intentions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jia Hongxia, Iqbal Shahid, Ayub Arslan
Abstract: Despite an escalated gravity of interest in exploring factors that shape university students' social entrepreneurial intentions, there are significant gaps in our understanding of this phenomenon. The current study examines the boundary effects of religiosity and spiritual intelligence to predict university students' social entrepreneurial intentions. The authors collected the data from university students in their final years in multiple waves and employed SmartPLS (v 4.0) for data analysis. Our findings indicate that religiosity can affect social entrepreneurial intentions through two paths: intrinsic motivation mediates the association between intrinsic religiosity and social entrepreneurial intentions, and extrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between extrinsic religiosity and social entrepreneurial intentions. Further, spiritual intelligence moderates the relationship between intrinsic religiosity and social entrepreneurial intentions, mediated by intrinsic motivation such that at high levels of spiritual intelligence the association is more potent and vice versa. This is the first study that examines the boundary conditions of social entrepreneurial intentions of university students by employing the lens of religiosity and spirituality. The paper presents substantial theoretical and practical implications.

Title: The Ecology of Social Learning in Animals and its Link with Intelligence.
Year: 2017
Authors: van Schaik Carel, Graber Sereina, Schuppli Caroline, Burkart Judith
Abstract: Classical ethology and behavioral ecology did not pay much attention to learning. However, studies of social learning in nature reviewed here reveal the near-ubiquity of reliance on social information for skill acquisition by developing birds and mammals. This conclusion strengthens the plausibility of the cultural intelligence hypothesis for the evolution of intelligence, which assumes that selection on social learning abilities automatically improves individual learning ability. Thus, intelligent species will generally be cultural species. Direct tests of the cultural intelligence hypothesis require good estimates of the amount and kind of social learning taking place in nature in a broad variety of species. These estimates are lacking so far. Here, we start the process of developing a functional classification of social learning, in the form of the social learning spectrum, which should help to predict the mechanisms of social learning involved. Once validated, the categories can be used to estimate the cognitive demands of social learning in the wild.

Title: A Recognition Method for Road Hypnosis Based on Physiological Characteristics.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Bin, Shi Huili, Chen Longfei, Wang Xiaoyuan, Wang Gang, Zhong Fusheng
Abstract: Road hypnosis is a state which is easy to appear frequently in monotonous scenes and has a great influence on traffic safety. The effective detection for road hypnosis can improve the intelligent vehicle. In this paper, the simulated experiment and vehicle experiment are designed and carried out to obtain the physiological characteristics data of road hypnosis. A road hypnosis recognition model based on physiological characteristics is proposed. Higher-order spectra are used to preprocess the electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) data, which can be further fused by principal component analysis (PCA). The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models are constructed to identify road hypnosis. The proposed model has good identification performance on road hypnosis. It provides more alternative methods and technical support for real-time and accurate identification of road hypnosis. It is of great significance to improve the intelligence and active safety of intelligent vehicles.

Title: Mediating effects of emotional intelligence on the relationship between empathy and humanistic care ability in nursing students: A cross-sectional descriptive study.
Year: 2022
Authors: Lina Meng, Qin Guan, Yang Li
Abstract: Patient-centered nursing holistic care is of utmost important to the nursing profession, and humanistic care cultivation has become a global nursing education concern. This study aimed to examine the relationship among emotional intelligence, empathy and humanistic care ability in nursing students, and to determine whether positive emotional intelligence could mediate the relationship between empathy and humanistic care ability. This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design. A total of 323 nursing students was enrolled from one medical university in Heilongjiang Province, China. The emotional intelligence questionnaires, empathy scale and humanistic care ability scale were used to quantify participants' responses. There was no significant difference in gender, residence, single-child family and leader experience of nursing students' humanistic care ability. However, the significant differences were found in grade (t = 4.55, P < .01) and major interests (t = 7.06, P < .01). Obviously, there was positive correlation between positive emotional intelligence and empathy (R = 0.37, P < .01), and positive correlation between humanistic care ability and emotional intelligence (R = 0.62, P < .01), and empathy (R = 0.57, P < .01). Furthermore, emotional intelligence (β = 0.21, P < .01) had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between humanistic care ability and empathy. Nurse educators should improve the empathy of nursing students by developing and implementing emotional intelligence programs, in order to improve their humanistic care ability.

Title: Road-Type Classification with Deep AutoEncoder.
Year: 2023
Authors: Molefe Mohale E, Tapamo Jules R
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are among the driving forces towards the success of intelligent road network systems design. Such algorithms allow for the design of systems that provide safe road usage, efficient infrastructure, and traffic flow management. One such application of machine learning in intelligent road networks is classifying different road network types that provide useful traffic information to road users. We propose a deep autoencoder model for representation learning to classify road network types. Each road segment node is represented as a feature vector. Unlike existing graph embedding methods that perform road segment embedding using the neighbouring road segments, the proposed method performs embedding directly on the road segment vectors. The proposed method performs embedding directly on the road segment vectors. Comparison with state-of-the-art graph embedding methods show that the proposed method outperforms graph convolution networks, GraphSAGE-MEAN, graph attention networks, and graph isomorphism network methods, and it achieves similar performance to GraphSAGE-MAXPOOL.

Title: Mindsets May Matter in Nursing Education.
Year: 2018
Authors: Williams Cheryl A
Abstract: Nursing education needs innovative and effective teaching models that are easily conveyed and economical. Dweck's mindset model harnesses the predictive power of noncognitive factors such as motivation, perseverance, effort, and academic tenacity to shape the learner's perceptions of intelligence for competency development. All individuals possess perceptions of intelligence; however, the mindset model demonstrates the immense potential associated with endorsement of the growth mindset and student success.

Title: [Artificial Intelligence and employee's health - new challenges].
Year: 2023
Authors: Walusiak-Skorupa Jolanta, Kaczmarek Paulina, Wiszniewska Marta
Abstract: The presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in many areas of social life is becoming widespread. The advantages of AI are being observed in medicine, commerce, automobiles, customer service, agriculture and production in factory settings, among others. Workers first encountered robots in the work environment in the 1960s. Since then, intelligent systems have become much more advanced. The expansion of AI functionality in the work environment exacerbates human health risks. These can be physical (lack of adequate machine control, accidents) or psychological (technostress, fear, automation leading to job exclusion, changes in the labour market, widening social differences).

Title: Psychopathy: Relations with three conceptions of intelligence.
Year: 2016
Authors: Watts Ashley L, Salekin Randall T, Harrison Natalie, Clark Abby, Waldman Irwin D, Vitacco Michael J, Lilienfeld Scott O
Abstract: Psychopathy is often associated with heightened intelligence in the eyes of clinicians and laypersons despite mixed research support for this possibility. We adopted a fine-grained approach to studying the relations among psychopathy and multiple indices of intelligence, including both cognitively based intelligence (CBI) and emotional intelligence (EI), in a large sample of undergraduates (N = 1,257, 70% female, 82% Caucasian). We found no clear support for marked associations between psychopathy and CB I measures, with the magnitudes of these relations being small. With the exception of the dimensions of Fearless Dominance (FD) and Coldheartedness (C), psychopathy dimensions were negatively associated with (EI). In contrast, we found some support for the hypothesis that intelligence served as a protective factor against antisocial behavior among individuals with high levels of psychopathy. On balance, our findings show weak relations between psychopathy and intelligence, suggesting that the link between them may be less robust than theoretical models portray, at least among undergraduates.

Title: Hubris and Humility Effect and the Domain-Masculine Intelligence Type in Two Countries: Colombia and the UK.
Year: 2016
Authors: Storek Josephine, Furnham Adrian
Abstract: Spanish-speaking Colombian (n = 50) and English-speaking British (N = 52) adults completed a self-assessed intelligence measure that yielded a score on domain-masculine intelligence (DMIQ), a composite of mathematical/logical and spatial intelligences. They also completed a Sex Role inventory in order to establish their masculinity and femininity. Males in both countries gave significantly higher self-estimates (Colombia: Males 110.36, Females 100.75, d = .94; England: Males 114.37, Females 105.75, d = .86; both p < .01) than females but sex role was note related to DMIQ. However there was a positive relationship between masculinity and DMIQ (r = .45, r = .39, p < .01), but only for males. Cultural issues in self-assessed intelligence and limitations, particularly sample size of this exploratory study are considered.

Authors: Zhao Xin-Gang, Zhou Kun, Xing Bangyu, Zhao Ruoting, Luo Shulin, Li Tianshu, Sun Yuanhui, Na Guangren, Xie Jiahao, Yang Xiaoyu, Wang Xinjiang, Wang Xiaoyu, He Xin, Lv Jian, Fu Yuhao, Zhang Lijun
Abstract: Materials informatics has emerged as a promisingly new paradigm for accelerating materials discovery and design. It exploits the intelligent power of machine learning methods in massive materials data from experiments or simulations to seek new materials, functionality, and principles, etc. Developing specialized facilities to generate, collect, manage, learn, and mine large-scale materials data is crucial to materials informatics. We herein developed an artificial-intelligence-aided data-driven infrastructure named Jilin Artificial-intelligence aided Materials-design Integrated Package (JAMIP), which is an open-source Python framework to meet the research requirements of computational materials informatics. It is integrated by materials production factory, high-throughput first-principles calculations engine, automatic tasks submission and monitoring progress, data extraction, management and storage system, and artificial intelligence machine learning based data mining functions. We have integrated specific features such as an inorganic crystal structure prototype database to facilitate high-throughput calculations and essential modules associated with machine learning studies of functional materials. We demonstrated how our developed code is useful in exploring materials informatics of optoelectronic semiconductors by taking halide perovskites as typical case. By obeying the principles of automation, extensibility, reliability, and intelligence, the JAMIP code is a promisingly powerful tool contributing to the fast-growing field of computational materials informatics.

Title: Why is intelligence associated with stability of happiness?
Year: 2014
Authors: Kanazawa Satoshi
Abstract: In the National Child Development Study, life-course variability in happiness over 18 years was significantly negatively associated with its mean level (happier individuals were more stable in their happiness, and it was not due to the ceiling effect), as well as childhood general intelligence and all Big Five personality factors (except for Agreeableness). In a multiple regression analysis, childhood general intelligence was the strongest predictor of life-course variability in life satisfaction, stronger than all Big Five personality factors, including Emotional stability. More intelligent individuals were significantly more stable in their happiness, and it was not entirely because: (1) they were more educated and wealthier (even though they were); (2) they were healthier (even though they were); (3) they were more stable in their marital status (even though they were); (4) they were happier (even though they were); (5) they were better able to assess their own happiness accurately (even though they were); or (6) they were better able to recall their previous responses more accurately or they were more honest in their survey responses (even though they were both). While I could exclude all of these alternative explanations, it ultimately remained unclear why more intelligent individuals were more stable in their happiness.

Title: The amygdala and the prefrontal cortex: The co-construction of intelligent decision-making.
Year: 2022
Authors: Dixon Matthew Luke, Dweck Carol S
Abstract: A revised view of the amygdala, its relationship with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and its role in intelligent human decision-making is proposed. Based on recent findings, we present a framework in which the amygdala plays a central role in the value computations that determine which goals are worth pursuing, while the PFC plays a central role in generating and evaluating possible action plans to realize these goals. We suggest that the amygdala and PFC continuously work together during decision-making and goal pursuit as individuals compute and recompute the value and likelihood of different goals while interacting with a dynamic world. Once seen as chiefly involved in simple stimulus-outcome associative learning, the amygdala is shown to play a sophisticated role in human decision-making by contributing to the moment-by-moment integration of multiple costs and benefits to determine optimal choices. We discuss implications of the framework for brain development, emotion regulation, intelligence, and psychopathology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Title: YOLO-G: Improved YOLO for cross-domain object detection.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wei Jian, Wang Qinzhao, Zhao Zixu
Abstract: Cross-domain object detection is a key problem in the research of intelligent detection models. Different from lots of improved algorithms based on two-stage detection models, we try another way. A simple and efficient one-stage model is introduced in this paper, comprehensively considering the inference efficiency and detection precision, and expanding the scope of undertaking cross-domain object detection problems. We name this gradient reverse layer-based model YOLO-G, which greatly improves the object detection precision in cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we add a feature alignment branch following the backbone, where the gradient reverse layer and a classifier are attached. With only a small increase in computational, the performance is higher enhanced. Experiments such as Cityscapes→Foggy Cityscapes, SIM10k→Cityscape, PASCAL VOC→Clipart, and so on, indicate that compared with most state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, the proposed model achieves much better mean Average Precision (mAP). Furthermore, ablation experiments were also performed on 4 components to confirm the reliability of the model. The project is available at https://github.com/airy975924806/yolo-G.

Title: Using resting thalamic connectivity to identify the relationship between Eysenck personality traits and intelligence in healthy adults.
Year: 2022
Authors: Li Yue, Zhao Wen-Tao, Qin Jian-Xing, Li Jing, Xu Yong
Abstract: Personality refers to a set of relatively stable psychological characteristics of individuals and has been associated with intelligence. It is well known that the thalamus plays an important role in cognitive processes and personality traits, but the relationship between personality traits, thalamic function, and intelligence has rarely been directly explored. Hence, we investigated the relationship between Eysenck personality traits, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the thalamus, and intelligence in a large sample of healthy adults (N = 176). We found that the trait of psychoticism was negatively associated with intelligence. The high intelligence group showed significantly lower psychoticism and demonstrated enhanced thalamic connectivity to the amygdala, inferior parietal lobules, pallidum, medial superior/middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Furthermore, a mediation analysis indicated that the FC between the left thalamus and left amygdala significantly mediated the correlation between psychoticism and full IQ (FIQ). These findings suggest that intelligent people may be less prone to psychoticism. Meanwhile, thalamic rsFC may reflect individual differences in intelligence and play a key role in the relationship between personality traits and intellectual abilities.

Title: Exploring the Mindset of Veterinary Educators for Intelligence, Clinical Reasoning, Compassion, and Morality.
Year: 2022
Authors: Guttin Talia, Penny Light Tracy, Baillie Sarah
Abstract: Mindset theory describes whether an individual believes their intelligence can be honed and improved with effort or whether it is inherent and fixed. These two different perceptions are called <i>growth</i> and <i>fixed</i> mindsets, respectively. Previous research has shown that students with growth mindsets embrace challenges, strive for mastery, have better psychological well-being, and are more resilient than students with fixed mindsets. Mindset is contagious, and teachers' mindsets can influence students' mindsets, motivation, and feedback-seeking behaviors. This is the first study of the veterinary educator mindset. Previous research has shown that mindset can vary by subject or personal attributes, called domains. This study investigated mindset in four domains: intelligence, clinical reasoning, compassion, and morality. A survey was developed by combining two previously published mindset scales and was distributed electronically to the veterinary teaching faculty at St. George's University, Grenada. The survey participants (<i>n</i> = 38, response rate 56%) showed predominantly growth mindsets, with some variation by domain: for intelligence, 84.2% growth, 5.3% intermediate, 10.5% fixed mindset; for clinical reasoning, 92.1% growth, 5.3% intermediate, 2.6% fixed mindset; for compassion, 63.2% growth, 2.6% intermediate, 34.2% fixed; and for morality, 60.5% growth, 13.2% intermediate, and 26.3% fixed mindset. Fifteen participants (39.5%) had fixed mindsets in one or more domains. Twenty participants (52.6%) had growth mindsets in all four domains. There were no associations found between demographic variables and mindset. This study found that most of the veterinary teaching faculty at this university had growth mindsets in all domains investigated.

Title: Fluid Intelligence and the Cross-Frequency Coupling of Neuronal Oscillations.
Year: 2016
Authors: Chuderski Adam
Abstract: Several existing theoretical models predict that the individual capacity of working memory and abstract reasoning (fluid intelligence) strongly depends on certain features of neuronal oscillations, especially their cross-frequency coupling. Empirical evidence supporting these predictions is still scarce, but it makes the future studies on oscillatory coupling a promising line of research that can uncover the physiological underpinnings of fluid intelligence. Cross-frequency coupling may serve as the optimal level of description of neurocognitive processes, integrating their genetic, structural, neurochemical, and bioelectrical underlying factors with explanations in terms of cognitive operations driven by neuronal oscillations.

Title: New and emerging models of human intelligence.
Year: 2015
Authors: Conway Andrew R A, Kovacs Kristof
Abstract: In the last decade, new models of human intelligence have altered the theoretical landscape in psychometrics and cognitive science. In the current article, we provide an overview of key distinguishing features of these new models. Compared to 20th century models of intelligence, the new models proposed in the 21st century are unique for three primary reasons; (1) new models interpret the general factor, or g, as an emergent property reflecting the pattern of positive correlations observed among test scores, not as a causal latent variable, and therefore challenge the notion of general ability, (2) new models bridge correlational and experimental psychology and account for inter-individual differences in behavior in terms of intra-individual psychological processes, and (3) new models make novel predictions about the neural correlates of intelligent behavior.

Title: An evidenced-based perspective on the validity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the context of high intelligence.
Year: 2016
Authors: Rommelse Nanda, van der Kruijs Marieke, Damhuis Jochem, Hoek Ineke, Smeets Stijn, Antshel Kevin M, Hoogeveen Lianne, Faraone Stephen V
Abstract: The validity of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in individuals with high intelligence is disputed, since high intelligence may 'mimic' the symptoms of ADHD in the absence of the specific pathophysiological pathways for ADHD. Conversely, increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis may occur due to compensatory strategies in the highly intelligent individual. A systematic literature review was performed including cognitive and behavioral studies, addressing a specific set of criteria for validating ADHD in the context of high intelligence. Albeit limited in number, available results suggest that ADHD is a valid construct in the context of high intelligence, showing characteristic clinical features (except possibly for hyperactivity being a less specific pathology marker), course and outcome and a characteristic response to treatment. Importantly, ADHD and IQ are negatively correlated on nearly all phenotypic and cognitive constructs, underlining the need for taking IQ into account as potential moderator in ADHD studies and more systematically studying ADHD in the high intelligent population.

Title: Big cats as a model system for the study of the evolution of intelligence.
Year: 2017
Authors: Borrego Natalia
Abstract: Currently, carnivores, and felids in particular, are vastly underrepresented in cognitive literature, despite being an ideal model system for tests of social and ecological intelligence hypotheses. Within Felidae, big cats (Panthera) are uniquely suited to studies investigating the evolutionary links between social, ecological, and cognitive complexity. Intelligence likely did not evolve in a unitary way but instead evolved as the result of mutually reinforcing feedback loops within the physical and social environments. The domain-specific social intelligence hypothesis proposes that social complexity drives only the evolution of cognitive abilities adapted only to social domains. The domain-general hypothesis proposes that the unique demands of social life serve as a bootstrap for the evolution of superior general cognition. Big cats are one of the few systems in which we can directly address conflicting predictions of the domain-general and domain-specific hypothesis by comparing cognition among closely related species that face roughly equivalent ecological complexity but vary considerably in social complexity.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Aided Edge Intelligence Framework for Delay-Sensitive Industrial Applications.
Year: 2022
Authors: Zubair Islam Muhammad, Shahzad , Ali Rashid, Haider Amir, Kim Hyung Seok
Abstract: With the advancement in next-generation communication technologies, the so-called Tactile Internet is getting more attention due to its smart applications, such as haptic-enabled teleoperation systems. The stringent requirements such as delay, jitter, and packet loss of these delay-sensitive and loss-intolerant applications make it more challenging to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). In this regard, different haptic codec and control schemes were proposed for QoS and QoE provisioning in the Tactile Internet. However, they maximize the QoE while degrading the system's stability under varying delays and high packet rates. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning-based Intelligent Tactile Edge (ITE) framework to ensure both transparency and stability of teleoperation systems with high packet rates and variable time delay communication networks. The proposed ITE first estimates the network challenges, including communication delay, jitter, and packet loss, and then utilizes a Q-learning algorithm to select the optimal haptic codec scheme to reduce network load. The proposed framework aims to explore the optimal relationship between QoS and QoE parameters and make the tradeoff between stability and transparency during teleoperations. The simulation result indicates that the proposed strategy chooses the optimal scheme under different network impairments corresponding to the congestion level in the communication network while improving the QoS and maximizing the QoE. The end-to-end performance of throughput (1.5 Mbps) and average RTT (70 ms) during haptic communication is achieved with a learning rate and discounted factor value of 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. The results indicate that the communication system can successfully achieve the QoS and QoE requirements by employing the proposed ITE framework.

Title: Construction and Model Realization of Financial Intelligence System Based on Multisource Information Feature Mining.
Year: 2022
Authors: Li Jing
Abstract: Multisource information mining systems and related business intelligence technology are currently a hot topic of research. However, the current commercial applications and applications are not ideal in terms of application. Because there is still much work to be done before decision support, it is best to transition to them only financially. This paper examines the multisource part of the information used in mining and introduces research hotspots in the fields of accounting informatization, the development status of intelligent financial analysis software, the research and application status of data warehouse, data mining, and decision support systems. This paper examines the specific composition and content of a financial information system using information mining to lay a solid foundation. Financial intelligent analysis, financial intelligent monitoring, financial intelligent decision-making, and financial intelligent early warning are the four parts of the financial intelligent system. It then examined the structure and processing of the financial intelligence system and proposed a financial intelligence system operation strategy. Financial intelligence low-risk integrated implementation strategies and ideal financial intelligence models, according to the current state of research and practical applications. According to the findings, the overall discrimination accuracy of the financial information system based on mining multisource information features is up to 95%, which is 42% higher than the traditional model. The development and use of financial information benefit from the realization and exploration of the financial intelligence system model.

The lab equipment is officially put into use, the information platform is also in the trial run stage, and the system is tested in time during the operation stage to provide the basis for the improvement of the system functions. Use data to conduct an in-depth analysis of learning situations and learning process analysis, optimize the reasonable construction of a personalized learning environment, serve personalized learning, and achieve the most optimal learning effect. The secondary development of the Turing robot provides a personalized auxiliary Q&A system for teaching, allowing artificial intelligence-assisted teaching to be integrated into the curriculum. With the help of teaching law courses, the empirical study demonstrates that the personalized learning environment has significant advantages in improving teaching effectiveness.

Title: Intelligence is associated with the modular structure of intrinsic brain networks.
Year: 2017
Authors: Hilger Kirsten, Ekman Matthias, Fiebach Christian J, Basten Ulrike
Abstract: General intelligence is a psychological construct that captures in a single metric the overall level of behavioural and cognitive performance in an individual. While previous research has attempted to localise intelligence in circumscribed brain regions, more recent work focuses on functional interactions between regions. However, even though brain networks are characterised by substantial modularity, it is unclear whether and how the brain's modular organisation is associated with general intelligence. Modelling subject-specific brain network graphs from functional MRI resting-state data (N = 309), we found that intelligence was not associated with global modularity features (e.g., number or size of modules) or the whole-brain proportions of different node types (e.g., connector hubs or provincial hubs). In contrast, we observed characteristic associations between intelligence and node-specific measures of within- and between-module connectivity, particularly in frontal and parietal brain regions that have previously been linked to intelligence. We propose that the connectivity profile of these regions may shape intelligence-relevant aspects of information processing. Our data demonstrate that not only region-specific differences in brain structure and function, but also the network-topological embedding of fronto-parietal as well as other cortical and subcortical brain regions is related to individual differences in higher cognitive abilities, i.e., intelligence.

Title: Intelligent problem-solvers externalize cognitive operations.
Year: 2019
Authors: Bocanegra Bruno R, Poletiek Fenna H, Ftitache Bouchra, Clark Andy
Abstract: Humans are nature's most intelligent and prolific users of external props and aids (such as written texts, slide-rules and software packages). Here we introduce a method for investigating how people make active use of their task environment during problem-solving and apply this approach to the non-verbal Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices test for fluid intelligence. We designed a click-and-drag version of the Raven test in which participants could create different external spatial configurations while solving the puzzles. In our first study, we observed that the click-and-drag test was better than the conventional static test at predicting academic achievement of university students. This pattern of results was partially replicated in a novel sample. Importantly, environment-altering actions were clustered in between periods of apparent inactivity, suggesting that problem-solvers were delicately balancing the execution of internal and external cognitive operations. We observed a systematic relationship between this critical phasic temporal signature and improved test performance. Our approach is widely applicable and offers an opportunity to quantitatively assess a powerful, although understudied, feature of human intelligence: our ability to use external objects, props and aids to solve complex problems.

Title: Race, Ethnicity, and the Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis: A Cautionary Example of Fringe Science Entering the Mainstream.
Year: 2022
Authors: Giangrande Evan J, Turkheimer Eric
Abstract: In 2020, Pesta et al. published an article entitled "Racial and Ethnic Group Differences in the Heritability of Intelligence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis" in the journal <i>Intelligence</i>. The authors framed their analysis as an examination of the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis, which holds that the heritability of intelligence varies as a function of socioeconomic status. Pesta et al. concluded that the heritability of intelligence does not differ across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. They claimed their results challenge the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and support the hereditarian position that mean differences in IQ among racial and ethnic groups are attributable to genetic differences rather than environmental disparities. In this commentary, we outline severe theoretical, methodological, and rhetorical flaws in every step of Pesta et al.'s meta-analysis. The most reliable finding from Pesta et al. is consistent with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and directly contradicts a hereditarian understanding of group differences in intelligence. Finally, we suggest that Pesta et al. serves as an example of how racially motivated and poorly executed work can find its way into a mainstream scientific journal, underscoring the importance of robust peer review and rigorous editorial judgment in the open-science era.

Title: An Intelligent Control Model of Credit Line Computing in Intelligence Health-Care Systems.
Year: 2021
Authors: Jiang Rong, Wu Wenxuan, Yu Yimin, Ma Feng
Abstract: Technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence have brought about a tremendous change to biomedical computing and intelligence health care. As a principal component of the intelligence healthcare system, the hospital information system (HIS) has provided great convenience to hospitals and patients, but incidents of leaking private information of patients through HIS occasionally occur at times. Therefore, it is necessary to properly control excessive access behavior. To reduce the risk of patient privacy leakage when medical data are accessed, this article proposes a dynamic permission intelligent access control model that introduces credit line calculation. According to the target given by the doctor in HIS and the actual access record, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code is used to describe the degree of correlation, and the rationality of the access is formally described by a mathematical formula. The concept of intelligence healthcare credit lines is redefined with relevance and time Windows. The access control policy matches the corresponding credit limit and credit interval according to the authorization rules to achieve the purpose of intelligent control. Finally, with the actual data provided by a Grade-III Level-A hospital in Kunming, the program code is written through machine learning and biomedical computing-related technologies to complete the experimental test. The experiment proves that the intelligent access control model based on credit computing proposed in this study can play a role in protecting the privacy of patients to a certain extent.

Abstract: With the wide application of artificial intelligence and big data technology in the medical field, the problems of high cost and low efficiency of traditional pharmacy management were becoming more and more obvious. Therefore, this paper proposed to use data mining technology to design and develop the dispensing process and equipment of intelligent pharmacy. Firstly, it summarized the existing data mining technology and association rule methods and expounded its application value in the related fields. Secondly, the data standard and integration platform of dispensing in intelligent pharmacy were established. Web service technology was used to design the interactive interface and call it to the intelligent device of pharmacy. Finally, an intelligent pharmacy management system based on association rule mining was constructed through the data mining of intelligent pharmacy equipment, in order to improve the intelligence and informatization of modern pharmacy management. For the emergency dispensing process of intelligent equipment failure, data mining was used to optimize the intelligent pharmacy equipment and dispensing process and change the pharmacy management from traditional prescription to patient drug treatment, so as to improve the dispensing efficiency of intelligent pharmacy equipment. Through the systematic test and analysis, the results showed that through the real-time risk prevention and control, the formula accuracy and operation speed of the intelligent dispensing machine were improved and the dispensing time was shortened. Through intelligent drug delivery, the unreasonable drug use of patients was reduced, the safety and effectiveness of clinical drug use were ensured, and the contradiction between doctors and patients was reduced. This study can not only optimize the medical experience of patients and provide patients with more high-quality and humanized pharmaceutical technical services but also provide some support for the intelligent management of modern hospitals.

Title: Compliance with COVID-19 Preventive Measures: The Role of Intelligence, the Dark Triad and Dysfunctional Impulsivity.
Year: 2023
Authors: Morales-Vives Fabia, Ferrando Pere J, Vigil-Colet Andreu, Dueñas Jorge-Manuel
Abstract: Although measures to prevent COVID-19 infection have been greatly relaxed in many countries, they are still quite stringent in others. However, not all citizens comply with them to the same extent. Many studies show the importance of personality traits in predicting compliance with these measures, but it is not so clear what the role of intelligence is. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether intelligence is related to compliance with these measures, and what its predictive role is when considered together with the dark triad and dysfunctional impulsivity.

Year: 2021
Authors: Liu Qiaofeng, Huang Jinglun, Zhang Bin, Zhao Jihong, Zhang Chengyun, Gao Xiang
Abstract: <i>Objective.</i> The mainstream development trend in the era of intelligent sports. At present, with the rapid development of science and technology, it is absolutely wise to combine group intelligence with community intelligent sports services for the elderly. Group intelligence has opened a new era of intelligent sports service. Group intelligence has become an important factor in the development and growth of community intelligent sports service for the elderly and has become a hot topic at present. However, intelligence has encountered difficulties on the road of development. At present, the aging of the population is getting worse and worse, and the elderly have higher and higher requirements for fitness and leisure services, which leads to the need for sports services to be continuously strengthened. The distribution of resources is uneven, the data is not clear enough, and the swarm intelligence algorithm is not perfect. With the adaptation of the elderly to intelligence, more intelligent, concise, and personalized services need to be developed. The most important method is to optimize the swarm intelligence algorithm continuously. In this paper, PSO algorithm is optimized and HCSSPSO algorithm is proposed. HCSSPSO algorithm is a combination of PSO algorithm and clonal selection strategy, and test simulation experiments, PSO algorithm, CLPSO algorithm, and HCSSPSO algorithm for comparison. From the experimental results, HCSSPSO algorithm has better convergence speed and stability, whether it is data or comparison graph. The data optimized by HCSSPSO algorithm is higher than the original data and the other two algorithms in terms of satisfaction and resource allocation.

Abstract: To solve the inspection problems in cotton storage, as well as the need for environmental monitoring in the process of modern cotton bale storage, an intelligent inspection and temperature and humidity intelligent monitoring system based on RFID cotton bale was developed by adopting RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology, wireless temperature and humidity real-time monitoring technology and handheld terminal intelligent inspection technology. The system was composed of RFID positioning inspection module and temperature and humidity real-time monitoring and transmission module. The artificial neural network (ANN) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to process the monitoring data of the system by Gaussian filtering, and an accurate classification model of RSSI and label position was established. The test results showed that: Through the comparative analysis of the RFID indoor positioning algorithm, the positioning error of the PSO-ANN algorithm was small. In the actual cotton bale warehouse test, the relative error of positioning and monitoring for RFID cotton bale intelligent inspection and monitoring system was less than 6.7%, which effectively improved the working efficiency of inspection personnel and the security of cotton bale storage. The relative error of temperature and humidity was less than 8% and less than 7%, which could display the temperature and humidity information in real time and meet the real-time demand. This study improved the management personnel's effective positioning and inspection of the cotton bale, prevented the loss of cotton bale, reduced the deterioration probability of cotton bale, and effectively improved the storage management level of the cotton bale. It was of great practical significance to realize the networking, automation, and intelligence of cotton bale storage management.

Title: Reliability constrained dynamic generation expansion planning using honey badger algorithm.
Year: 2023
Authors: Abou El Ela Adel A, El-Sehiemy Ragab A, Shaheen Abdullah M, Shalaby Ayman S, Mouafi Mohamed T
Abstract: Generation expansion planning (GEP) is a complex, highly constrained, non-linear, discrete and dynamic optimization task aimed at determining the optimum generation technology mix of the best expansion alternative for long-term planning horizon. This paper presents a new framework to study the GEP in a multi-stage horizon with reliability constrained. GEP problem is presented to minimize the capital investment costs, salvage value cost, operation and maintenance, and outage cost under several constraints over planning horizon. Added to that, the spinning reserve, fuel mix ratio and reliability in terms of Loss of Load Probability are maintained. Moreover, to decrease the GEP problem search space and reduce the computational time, some modifications are proposed such as the Virtual mapping procedure, penalty factor approach, and the modified of intelligent initial population generation. For solving the proposed reliability constrained GEP problem, a novel honey badger algorithm (HBA) is developed. It is a meta-heuristic search algorithm inspired from the intelligent foraging behavior of honey badger to reach its prey. In HBA, the dynamic search behavior of honey badger with digging and honey finding approaches is formulated into exploration and exploitation phases. Added to that, several modern meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are employed which are crow search algorithm, aquila optimizer, bald eagle search and particle swarm optimization. These algorithms are applied, in a comparative manner, for three test case studies for 6-year, 12-year, and 24-year of short- and long-term planning horizon having five types of candidate units. The obtained results by all these proposed algorithms are compared and validated the effectiveness and superiority of the HBA over the other applied algorithms.

Authors: Shilin Wu
Abstract: The continuous development of the society has led to the improvement of people's quality of life and consumption level. At the same time, peoples demand for all aspects of production and life is also increasing, thus promoting the emergence and innovation of intelligent household appliances. To manage these devices conveniently and quickly and enrich family life, "smart home" bureau plays a very important role. Smart home, which enters people's family life, uses communication technology, Internet connection technology, automatic fire control technology, network wiring technology, and visual and audio transmission technology to communicate with home. Mobile terminals have been developed, and more and more PC functions have been realized. Based on the hardware platform of the smart home management system, two solutions were put forward. The first solution is combined with the current 5G network, and through it, the user can control the mobile phone and other mobile terminals on the corresponding application operation instructions to create. The second solution is the design of the web server intelligent management system, for relevant information. It is collected into the database of the server, allows remote access to the node and subscriber information related to storage in the database through the Internet, and searches the information to control the home lighting and temperature. This system is designed to imitate the modular scheme, which includes the central control module, sensor data acquisition module, and software module. Finally, on the browser side and the electronic devices of Android operating system, it realizes the wireless control of lighting, air conditioning, washing machine, and other devices, as well as the detection of the home environment.

Title: Communication as a fundamental part of machiavellian intelligence.
Year: 2018
Authors: Lucas Jeffrey R, Gentry Katherine E, Sieving Kathryn E, Freeberg Todd M
Abstract: The Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis proposes that individuals in complex social groups require sophisticated social cognition. This hypothesis has advanced our understanding of the complex social lives of animals and how individuals interact with others in their groups. Machiavellian intelligence is the capacity of an individual to alter the behavior of others around it to the individual's own advantage. This capacity is typically facilitated by complex communicative systems, social systems, and cognitive abilities. Curiously, communication among group members has not traditionally been a focus of research related to the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis. Here, we show how a focus on communicative and cognitive complexity together can elucidate nuanced manipulations for selfish gains in socially complex groups, under both competitive and cooperative scenarios. Finally, we argue more generally that a research emphasis on communication in complex social groups may accelerate our understanding of the social mechanisms underlying complex adaptive behavior.

Title: An Embodied Intelligence-Based Biologically Inspired Strategy for Searching a Moving Target.
Year: 2022
Authors: Tan Julian K P, Tan Chee Pin, Nurzaman Surya G
Abstract: Bacterial chemotaxis in unicellular Escherichia coli, the simplest biological creature, enables it to perform effective searching behaviour even with a single sensor, achieved via a sequence of "tumbling" and "swimming" behaviours guided by gradient information. Recent studies show that suitable random walk strategies may guide the behaviour in the absence of gradient information. This article presents a novel and minimalistic biologically inspired search strategy inspired by bacterial chemotaxis and embodied intelligence concept: a concept stating that intelligent behaviour is a result of the interaction among the "brain," body morphology including the sensory sensitivity tuned by the morphology, and the environment. Specifically, we present bacterial chemotaxis inspired searching behaviour with and without gradient information based on biological fluctuation framework: a mathematical framework that explains how biological creatures utilize noises in their behaviour. Via extensive simulation of a single sensor mobile robot that searches for a moving target, we will demonstrate how the effectiveness of the search depends on the sensory sensitivity and the inherent random walk strategies produced by the brain of the robot, comprising Ballistic, Levy, Brownian, and Stationary search. The result demonstrates the importance of embodied intelligence even in a behaviour inspired by the simplest creature.

Title: Task-Incremental Learning for Drone Pilot Identification Scheme.
Year: 2023
Authors: Han Liyao, Zhong Xiangping, Zhang Yanning
Abstract: With the maturity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology and the development of Industrial Internet of Things, drones have become an indispensable part of intelligent transportation systems. Due to the absence of an effective identification scheme, most commercial drones suffer from impersonation attacks during their flight procedure. Some pioneering works have already attempted to validate the pilot's legal status at the beginning and during the flight time. However, the off-the-shelf pilot identification scheme can not adapt to the dynamic pilot membership management due to a lack of extensibility. To address this challenge, we propose an incremental learning-based drone pilot identification scheme to protect drones from impersonation attacks. By utilizing the pilot temporal operational behavioral traits, the proposed identification scheme could validate pilot legal status and dynamically adapt newly registered pilots into a well-constructed identification scheme for dynamic pilot membership management. After systemic experiments, the proposed scheme was capable of achieving the best average identification accuracy with 95.71% on P450 and 94.23% on S500. With the number of registered pilots being increased, the proposed scheme still maintains high identification performance for the newly added and the previously registered pilots. Owing to the minimal system overhead, this identification scheme demonstrates high potential to protect drones from impersonation attacks.

Title: Exploration of the intelligent-auxiliary design of architectural space using artificial intelligence model.
Year: 2023
Authors: Li Hongyu, Wu Qilong, Xing Bowen, Wang Wenjie
Abstract: In order to carry out a comprehensive design description of the specific architectural model of AI, the auxiliary model of AI and architectural spatial intelligence is deeply integrated, and flexible design is carried out according to the actual situation. AI assists in the generation of architectural intention and architectural form, mainly supporting academic and working theoretical models, promoting technological innovation, and thus improving the design efficiency of the architectural design industry. AI-aided architectural design enables every designer to achieve design freedom. At the same time, with the help of AI, architectural design can complete the corresponding work faster and more efficiently. With the help of AI technology, through the adjustment and optimization of keywords, AI automatically generates a batch of architectural space design schemes. Against this background, the auxiliary model of architectural space design is established through the literature research of the AI model, the architectural space intelligent auxiliary model, and the semantic network and the internal structure analysis of architectural space. Secondly, to ensure compliance with the three-dimensional characteristics of the architectural space from the data source, based on the analysis of the overall function and structure of space design, the intelligent design of the architectural space auxiliary by Deep Learning is carried out. Finally, it takes the 3D model selected in the UrbanScene3D data set as the research object, and the auxiliary performance of AI's architectural space intelligent model is tested. The research results show that with the increasing number of network nodes, the model fitting degree on the test data set and training data set is decreasing. The fitting curve of the comprehensive model shows that the intelligent design scheme of architectural space based on AI is superior to the traditional architectural design scheme. As the number of nodes in the network connection layer increases, the intelligent score of space temperature and humidity will continue to rise. The model can achieve the optimal intelligent auxiliary effect of architectural space. The research has practical application value for promoting the intelligent and digital transformation of architectural space design.

Authors: Knecht Erwin, Klionsky Daniel J
Abstract: Getting to know Erwin Knecht is not so simple. This view was summarized in a comment from Dr. Marta Martinez Vicente, who obtained her PhD degree working in a lab that shared space with Erwin's group: "Erwin Knecht is a complex character, who awakens contradictory feelings. To define him I would say that he is a mixture of intelligence and madness, he's witty, very funny but also grumpy and cranky, all mixed and all simultaneously. Without a doubt he is a person who will not leave anyone indifferent, his original personality marked all who crossed his path, doctoral students, collaborators, people who attended his talks, etc … I remember the weekly lab meetings with him; we, the students, had a lot of respect for him (not to mention fear), but his comments were always smart, helpful and constructive, he has always been prone to helping everyone. In the lab, he was extremely demanding, but got people under his supervision to do their best. And despite his usual moodiness, he managed to make everyone love him and have a special affection for him. Above all, I remember his screams throughout the laboratory that could be heard from all over the building, calling out to his laboratory technician: 'Asunción!' They were like an old couple, arguing all day but they couldn't be without each other, it was like watching a sitcom every day." If you are intrigued, please read on.

Authors: Fu Kuiliang
Abstract: The traditional teaching mode is to use a point-to-point mode or a computer-aided system for teaching, but this limits students' enthusiasm and interest in learning. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is a technology that integrates sensors, the Internet, and terminals to transmit information in real time. The smart education based on the Internet of Things can realize remote teaching and actual scene teaching, and students can freely choose the learning location and time, which can greatly improve students learning interest and learning efficiency, which is a development trend of a new teaching method. Smart IoT teaching is a teaching method that combines IoT technology and artificial intelligence technology. This paper mainly studies the research and analysis of the smart education model based on the IoT in remote teaching. In this paper, sensor technologies such as cameras will be used to collect students' expressions, speech, and other actions in class from different regions. These data features will be processed by the terminal's intelligent algorithm, and the desired knowledge will be obtained according to the students' behavior information. The information processed by the intelligent algorithm will be transmitted to the terminal system where the teacher is located, such as computer and mobile phone. This paper focuses on analyzing the reliability and accuracy of the intelligent algorithm of the IoT smart education terminal. The results show that the prediction error of the student behavior information is within 3% and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.99.

Authors: Khan Habib Ullah, Nazir Shah
Abstract: We know that in today's advanced world, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-grounded methodologies are playing a very optimistic role in performing difficult and time-consuming activities very conveniently and quickly. However, for the training and testing of these procedures, the main factor is the availability of a huge amount of data, called big data. With the emerging techniques of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and the Internet of Things (IoT), it is very feasible to collect a large volume of data with the help of smart and intelligent sensors. Based on these smart sensing devices, very innovative and intelligent hardware components can be made for prediction and recognition purposes. A detailed discussion was carried out on the development and employment of various detectors for providing people with effective services, especially in the case of smart cities. With these devices, a very healthy and intelligent environment can be created for people to live in safely and happily. With the use of modern technologies in integration with smart sensors, it is possible to use energy resources very productively. Smart vehicles can be developed to sense any emergency, to avoid injuries and fatal accidents. These sensors can be very helpful in management and monitoring activities for the enhancement of productivity. Several significant aspects are obtained from the available literature, and significant articles are selected from the literature to properly examine the uses of sensor technology for the development of smart infrastructure. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to give these attributes weights. Finally, the weights are used with the multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) technique to provide the different options in their order of importance.

Authors: Jing Yumei
Abstract: Mental health problems will seriously damage social harmony and family happiness. This paper proposes a study on mental health intelligence assessment based on multisource information fusion. Combining the data description of UPI and SCL-90 and the corresponding task requirement analysis, the multisource information fusion visualization based on the Circos diagram is designed and realized, and the parallel coordinate visualization is established. The MDS algorithm is used to project multidimensional survey objects into low-dimensional visualization space, and the actual UPI and SCL-90 questionnaire data for 278 students of a certain major at a university provided by the cooperative unit are used. The results show that the mental health problems of student A are serious, and the symptoms of depression and schizophrenia are prominent, so it is necessary to seek psychological experts for corresponding treatment in time. By contrast, student B's mental health problems are also serious, and the user judges that student B still needs further diagnosis and treatment. The correlation analysis results of multisource information fusion are roughly the same as the actual situation, which is convincing. Therefore, the multisource mental health information fusion of college students has a certain correlation and complementarity.

Title: Design of Digital and Intelligent Financial Decision Support System Based on Artificial Intelligence.
Year: 2022
Authors: Jia Tiejun, Wang Cheng, Tian Zhiqiang, Wang Bingyin, Tian Feng
Abstract: The quality of financial decision-making is very important to the future development of an enterprise, but it is often affected by the completeness of useful information for decision-making and the subjective factors of decision makers, and is often unstable. With the development of computer technology, the financial decision support system came into being, which improved the quality of financial decision to some extent. However, although the existing financial decision support system has achieved dataization to a certain extent, it still faces problems such as artificial leadership, insufficient intelligence, and poor decision-making efficiency, and cannot fully meet the needs of decision-makers. The explosion of artificial intelligence technology in recent years has provided potential improvements to financial decision support systems. In this article, we conduct a detailed analysis of the deficiencies in the current financial decision support system, build the mechanism and implementation path of the financial decision support system under artificial intelligence, and design a digital and intelligent financial decision support system. At the same time, we apply the proposed financial decision support system to the financial practice of <i>X</i> enterprise. Through the questionnaire survey, it is found that through the comprehensive application of artificial intelligence technology, the new system has a higher degree of intelligence than the existing system, and its construction can effectively improve the timeliness and accuracy of financial decision-making, while reducing the cost of financial decision-making. It is conducive to promoting the integration of management accounting and financial accounting.

Title: Research on the Development of Hospital Intelligent Finance Based on Artificial Intelligence.
Year: 2022
Authors: Ma Mengxuan
Abstract: Based on the development background of the interweaving and integration of computer technology and Internet technology, China's artificial intelligence industry is quietly rising. In the social life of the information age, the artificial intelligence industry represented by machine deep learning is playing a very important role. This study in combination with the background of the new health reform, in view of the reform of the medical industry, analyzes the connotation of financial wisdom based on the important role of the hospital financial development problems, puts forward the development direction of artificial intelligence hospital financial wisdom development measures, designed to meet the changing external environment demand, reduces human costs, and improves the overall efficiency of hospital financial fund management. Based on the evaluation results, this paper proposes the correct direction for the development of hospital intelligence finance by using the BP neural network model. After the analysis, it is found that the development of artificial intelligence is an important measure to promote the development of hospital intelligent finance. In other words, hospital intelligent financial management is the product of the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology. At the present stage, the intelligent financial management problems of hospitals are mainly as follows: (1) lack of financial informatization, (2) lack of perfect financial risk early warning system, and (3) the phenomenon of "information island" in the financial system. After analyzing the above problems, the research believes that the development of hospital intelligent finance based on artificial intelligence needs to solve the above thorny problems, so as to improve the outcome of hospital intelligent finance development. The following work should be done: (1) strengthen the design of information sharing module, (2) intelligent control of the cost of hospitals, and (3) intelligent treatment of hospital accounting. Combining the development of artificial intelligence and hospital intelligent finance theory, combined with the actual trend of financial intelligence development under the background of artificial intelligence development in the new era, it provides scientific basis for the development of hospital intelligent finance.

Title: The neural basis of intelligence in fine-grained cortical topographies.
Year: 2021
Authors: Feilong Ma, Guntupalli J Swaroop, Haxby James V
Abstract: Intelligent thought is the product of efficient neural information processing, which is embedded in fine-grained, topographically organized population responses and supported by fine-grained patterns of connectivity among cortical fields. Previous work on the neural basis of intelligence, however, has focused on coarse-grained features of brain anatomy and function because cortical topographies are highly idiosyncratic at a finer scale, obscuring individual differences in fine-grained connectivity patterns. We used a computational algorithm, hyperalignment, to resolve these topographic idiosyncrasies and found that predictions of general intelligence based on fine-grained (vertex-by-vertex) connectivity patterns were markedly stronger than predictions based on coarse-grained (region-by-region) patterns. Intelligence was best predicted by fine-grained connectivity in the default and frontoparietal cortical systems, both of which are associated with self-generated thought. Previous work overlooked fine-grained architecture because existing methods could not resolve idiosyncratic topographies, preventing investigation where the keys to the neural basis of intelligence are more likely to be found.

Title: Robust Multi-Sensor Consensus Plant Disease Detection Using the Choquet Integral.
Year: 2023
Authors: Marco-Detchart Cedric, Carrascosa Carlos, Julian Vicente, Rincon Jaime
Abstract: Over the last few years, several studies have appeared that employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve sustainable development in the agricultural sector. Specifically, these intelligent techniques provide mechanisms and procedures to facilitate decision-making in the agri-food industry. One of the application areas has been the automatic detection of plant diseases. These techniques, mainly based on deep learning models, allow for analysing and classifying plants to determine possible diseases facilitating early detection and thus preventing the propagation of the disease. In this way, this paper proposes an Edge-AI device that incorporates the necessary hardware and software components for automatically detecting plant diseases from a set of images of a plant leaf. In this way, the main goal of this work is to design an autonomous device that allows the detection of possible diseases that can detect potential diseases in plants. This will be achieved by capturing multiple images of the leaves and implementing data fusion techniques to enhance the classification process and improve its robustness. Several tests have been carried out to determine that the use of this device significantly increases the robustness of the classification responses to possible plant diseases.

Authors: Simić Svetlana, Villar José R, Calvo-Rolle José Luis, Sekulić Slobodan R, Simić Svetislav D, Simić Dragan
Abstract: (1) Background: Modern medicine generates a great deal of information that stored in medical databases. Simultaneously, extracting useful knowledge and making scientific decisions for diagnosis and treatment of diseases becomes increasingly necessary. Headache disorders are the most prevalent of all the neurological conditions. Headaches have not only medical but also great socioeconomic significance. The aim of this research is to develop an intelligent system for diagnosing primary headache disorders. (2) Methods: This research applied various mathematical, statistical and artificial intelligence techniques, among which the most important are: Calinski-Harabasz index, Analytical Hierarchy Process, and Weighted Fuzzy C-means Clustering Algorithm. These methods, techniques and methodologies are used to create a hybrid intelligent system for diagnosing primary headache disorders. The proposed intelligent diagnostic system is tested with original real-world data set with different metrics. (3) Results: First at all, nine of 20 attributes - features from International Headache Society (IHS) criteria are selected, and then only five most important attributes from IHS criteria are selected. The calculation result based on the Calinski-Harabasz index value (178) for the optimal number of clusters is three, and they present three classes of headaches: (i) migraine, (ii) tension-type headaches (TTHs), and (iii) other primary headaches (OPHs). The proposed hybrid intelligent system shows the following quality metrics: Accuracy 75%; Precision 67% for migraine, 74% for TTHs, 86% for OPHs, and Average Precision 77%; Recall 86% for migraine, 73% for TTHs, 67% for OPHs, Average Recall 75%; F<sub>1</sub> score 75% for migraine, 74% for TTHs, 75% for OPHs, and Average F<sub>1</sub> score 75%. (4) Conclusions: The hybrid intelligent system presents qualitative and respectable experimental results. The implementation of existing diagnostics systems and the development of new diagnostics systems in medicine is necessary in order to help physicians make quality diagnosis and decide the best treatments for the patients.

Title: Perceptions of intelligence & sentience shape children's interactions with robot reading companions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Caruana Nathan, Moffat Ryssa, Miguel-Blanco Aitor, Cross Emily S
Abstract: The potential for robots to support education is being increasingly studied and rapidly realised. However, most research evaluating education robots has neglected to examine the fundamental features that make them more or less effective, given the needs and expectations of learners. This study explored how children's perceptions, expectations and experiences are shaped by aesthetic and functional features during interactions with different robot 'reading buddies'. We collected a range of quantitative and qualitative measures of subjective experience before and after children read a book with one of three different robots. An inductive thematic analysis revealed that robots have the potential offer children an engaging and non-judgemental social context to promote reading engagement. This was supported by children's perceptions of robots as being intelligent enough to read, listen and comprehend the story, particularly when they had the capacity to talk. A key challenge in the use of robots for this purpose was the unpredictable nature of robot behaviour, which remains difficult to perfectly control and time using either human operators or autonomous algorithms. Consequently, some children found the robots' responses distracting. We provide recommendations for future research seeking to position seemingly sentient and intelligent robots as an assistive tool within and beyond education settings.

Title: The combination model of CNN and GCN for machine fault diagnosis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Qianqian, Hao Caiyun, Lv Zhongwei, Fan Qiuxia
Abstract: Learning powerful discriminative features is the key for machine fault diagnosis. Most existing methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have achieved promising results. However, they primarily focus on global features derived from sample signals and fail to explicitly mine relationships between signals. In contrast, graph convolutional network (GCN) is able to efficiently mine data relationships by taking graph data with topological structure as input, making them highly effective for feature representation in non-Euclidean space. In this article, to make good use of the advantages of CNN and GCN, we propose a graph attentional convolutional neural network (GACNN) for effective intelligent fault diagnosis, which includes two subnetworks of fully CNN and GCN to extract the multilevel features information, and uses Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) attention mechanism to reduce information loss. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our framework improves the representation ability of features and fault diagnosis performance, and achieves competitive accuracy against other approaches. And the results show that GACNN can achieve superior performance even under a strong background noise environment.

Title: Children's Motor Intelligence Evaluation System Based on Multi-data Fusion.
Year: 2022
Authors: Zhao Sihong
Abstract: Along with the main feedback information of early childhood education activities, children's movement evaluation plays an important guiding role in early childhood education activities. Teachers can teach children in accordance with their aptitude according to the results of children's sports evaluation. Traditional physical education overemphasizes the leading role of teachers, and young children can only passively receive the education of teachers. Teachers always use the same standard to evaluate each child, simply assigning a rating of "strong," "moderate," and "poor" to children, ignoring the differences in children's physical intelligence. The emergence of multidata fusion technology can use the differences and complementarity of various data in evaluation functions to make up for the insufficiency of a single exercise evaluation result, purposefully choose the evaluation method flexibly according to the content of the exercise and the scene of the exercise, and gradually improve the level of children's exercise evaluation. This paper studied the children's motor intelligence evaluation system based on multidata fusion. To this end, this paper will focus on children's autonomous sports games and determine the first-level indicators in the children's sports evaluation index system as four indicators: classroom performance, physical fitness, motor skills, and extracurricular fitness. It used the principle of multidata fusion, firstly evaluates children's exercise physiology data through a fuzzy neural network algorithm, and then combines the adaptive weighted data fusion algorithm with D-S evidence theory to evaluate children's movement intelligence. Experiments showed that the multidata evaluation system can take effective measures to intelligently evaluate children's comprehensive motor ability. Compared with the traditional evaluation method, the evaluation results are increased by 5%, and the children's sports evaluation results are more average, which can enhance children's sports confidence and promote children's effective exercise.

Title: Construction and Computation of the College English Teaching Path in the Artificial Intelligence Teaching Environment.
Year: 2022
Authors: Liu Shaojie
Abstract: Today, English is the world's main international language and is widely spoken. In this context, the learning of English has long been valued by all countries. In addition, English plays an essential role in the process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside world, its developing science and technology, and its rising international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking professionals. This will lay the foundation for China's economic and social development and enable China to play a greater and more active role in international affairs, which has great practical and far-reaching historical significance. At present, the traditional English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects. Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied to college English teaching. As information technology continues to evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how it can be better used in the teaching of subjects. Therefore, the use of online information technology in teaching and learning presents a great opportunity for research and practice in English language learning at the university level.

Title: A Data-Driven Intelligent System for Assistive Design of Interior Environments.
Year: 2022
Authors: Chen Guoxing
Abstract: This paper analyses the design of a healthy interior environment using big data intelligence. The application of big data intelligence in the design of healthy interior environments is necessary because the traditional interior design approaches consume a lot of energy and other problems. Benefited by its strong ability of computation and analytics, artificial intelligence can well improve a series of problems in the field of interior design. The proposal summarizes the sources, classifications, and expressions of behavioral data in interior spaces, carries out analysis and research on behavioral data from two aspects: display space and supermarket space, summarizes the interior methods based on behavioral data, and analyses the visualization application of behavioral data in different interior scenes, to explore the application value of behavioral data in interior design. In contrast to it is the unconscious behavioral response, the biggest characteristic of which is that it is regulated by the behavioral subject's physiological factors or habits of the behavior issuer. In this paper, we convert the layout recommendation problem of a space into a functional classification problem of segmented segments and household segments on a plane. The scene layout features are extracted by binary coding, the abstraction of the cross features between the vector segments is achieved by using a word embedding algorithm, the feature matrix is reduced in dimensionality, and finally, the segmentation network model and the layout network model are constructed, respectively, by using a bidirectional LSTM. The experiments show that the accuracy of the layout recommendation model in this paper is 98%, which can meet the demand for real-time online layouts.

Title: Genetically-mediated associations between measures of childhood character and academic achievement.
Year: 2016
Authors: Tucker-Drob Elliot M, Briley Daniel A, Engelhardt Laura E, Mann Frank D, Harden K Paige
Abstract: Researchers and the general public have become increasingly intrigued by the roles that systematic tendencies toward thinking, feeling, and behaving might play in academic achievement. Some measures of constructs belonging to this group have been well studied in genetics and psychometrics, while much less is known about measures of other such constructs. The current study focuses on 7 character traits prominently featured in influential intervention-oriented and/or socialization theories of academic achievement: grit, intellectual curiosity, intellectual self-concept, mastery orientation, educational value, intelligence mindset, and test motivation. In a population-based sample of 811 school-aged twins and triplets from the Texas Twin Project, we tested (a) how each measure relates to indices of the Big Five personality traits, (b) how the measures relate to one another, (c) the extent to which each measure is associated with genetic and environmental influences and whether such influences operate through common dimensions of individual differences, and (d) the extent to which genetic and environmental factors mediate the relations between fluid intelligence, character measures, verbal knowledge, and academic achievement. We find moderate relations among the measures that can be captured by a highly heritable common dimension representing a mixture of Openness and Conscientiousness. Moreover, genetically influenced variance in the character measures is associated with multiple measures of verbal knowledge and academic achievement, even after controlling for fluid intelligence. In contrast, environmentally influenced variance in character is largely unrelated to knowledge and achievement outcomes. We propose that character measures popularly used in education may be best conceptualized as indexing facets of personality that are of particular relevance to academic achievement.

Title: A Mode of Intelligent Equipment Monitoring Optimization Based on Dynamic Programming Algorithm.
Year: 2022
Authors: Zheng Zhilei, Jiang Chuan
Abstract: With the continuous development of the national economy and scientific productivity, urban construction and people's living standards are also getting higher and higher. Although people enjoy increasingly convenient life, the demand for intelligence is getting higher and higher. Digital intelligent equipment has the functions of data collection, calculation and analysis, diagnostic and early warning, and communication functions. Analyze the status quo and existing problems of the development of intelligent equipment, as well as analyze and research key monitoring technologies in the use and development of digital intelligent equipment and provide optimal solutions for intelligent equipment hardware development requirements, software development, and model algorithms. Intelligent equipment monitoring is related to all aspects of people's livelihood, and its intelligent development is related to the public role in this field in the future. Accurate results of monitoring can provide data support for schools, research institutions, the public, and the government. At the same time, it is also an important basis for formulating social policies. At present, the commonly used monitoring method usually adopts time series algorithm. Through literature review, it is found that the algorithm has the problem of distortion of correct data, which affects the accuracy of monitoring results. Based on the above reasons, this article combines the wavelet function with the planning algorithm and proposes a dynamic programming algorithm, which removes the redundant monitoring data in turn and clusters the distortion monitoring data with the wavelet function, which improves the accuracy and computational efficiency of the algorithm and gives full play to the monitoring of intelligence. The simulation results using MATLAB show that the planning algorithm can eliminate 90% of redundant monitoring data and improve the extraction rate of characteristic monitoring data. At the same time, the accuracy of the planning algorithm reaches 95%, and the calculation time is less than 25 s, which is better than the static planning algorithm. Therefore, the dynamic programming algorithm can better utilize the intelligence, convenience, and efficiency of the equipment to optimize the monitoring model.

Title: Playing Brains: The Ethical Challenges Posed by Silicon Sentience and Hybrid Intelligence in DishBrain.
Year: 2023
Authors: Milford Stephen R, Shaw David, Starke Georg
Abstract: The convergence of human and artificial intelligence is currently receiving considerable scholarly attention. Much debate about the resulting Hybrid Minds focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence into the human brain through intelligent brain-computer interfaces as they enter clinical use. In this contribution we discuss a complementary development: the integration of a functional in vitro network of human neurons into an in silico computing environment.To do so, we draw on a recent experiment reporting the creation of silico-biological intelligence as a case study (Kagan et al., 2022b). In this experiment, multielectrode arrays were plated with stem cell-derived human neurons, creating a system which the authors call DishBrain. By embedding the system into a virtual game-world, neural clusters were able to receive electrical input signals from the game-world and to respond appropriately with output signals from pre-assigned motor regions. Using this design, the authors demonstrate how the DishBrain self-organises and successfully learns to play the computer game 'Pong', exhibiting 'sentient' and intelligent behaviour in its virtual environment.The creation of such hybrid, silico-biological intelligence raises numerous ethical challenges. Following the neuroscientific framework embraced by the authors themselves, we discuss the arising ethical challenges in the context of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, focusing on the risk of creating synthetic phenomenology. Following the DishBrain's creator's neuroscientific assumptions, we highlight how DishBrain's design may risk bringing about artificial suffering and argue for a congruently cautious approach to such synthetic biological intelligence.

Title: Can worry and physiological anxiety uniquely predict children and adolescents' academic achievement and intelligence?
Year: 2021
Authors: Castagna Peter J, Calamia Matthew, Davis Iii Thompson E
Abstract: When exploring the relationship anxiety has with IQ, academic achievement studies often rely on diagnostic groups or total scores for an anxiety measure. The differential effects caused by anxiety dimensions, as well as their interactions, were examined with an exploratory method. This study examined the main effect of worry and physiological anxiety as predictors of youths' academic and cognitive functioning. Two samples of youth that presented to an out-patient clinic (<i>n =</i> 121, <i>M</i> = 10.59, <i>SD</i> = 2.78, range = 6-16; <i>n =</i> 92, <i>M</i> = 10.07, <i>SD</i> = 2.76, range = 6-16) were administered well-established performance measures of academic and intellectual functioning, along with a measurement of anxiety. In an exploratory analysis, the interaction between worry and physiological anxiety was the only significant effect, robust across all academic composites and intelligence indices. Physiological anxiety had a differential relationship with academic achievement domains (and processing speed) dependent on levels of worry; low-levels of worry were predictive of improved scores at high, but not low-, levels of physiological anxiety. In contrast, high-, but not low-, levels of physiological anxiety were associated with lower scores when accompanied by elevated levels of worry when predicting intelligence indices.

Title: A comprehensive evaluation model for the intelligent automobile cockpit comfort.
Year: 2022
Authors: Yang Jianjun, Xing Shanshan, Chen Yimeng, Qiu Ruizhi, Hua Chunrong, Dong Dawei
Abstract: Under the background of automobile intelligence, cockpit comfort is receiving increasing attention, and intelligent cockpit comfort evaluation is especially important. To study the intelligent cockpit comfort evaluation model, this paper divides the intelligent cockpit comfort influencing factors into four factors and influencing indices: acoustic environment, optical environment, thermal environment, and human-computer interaction environment. The subjective and objective evaluation methods are used to obtain the subjective weights and objective weights of each index by the analytic hierarchy process and the improved entropy weight method, respectively. On this basis, the weights are combined by using the game theory viewpoint to obtain a comprehensive evaluation model of the intelligent automobile cockpit comfort. Then, the cloud algorithm was used to generate the rank comprehensive cloud model of each index for comparison. The research results found that among the four main factors affecting the intelligent automobile cockpit comfort, human-computer interaction has the greatest impact on it, followed by the thermal environment, acoustic environment, and optical environment. The results of the study can be used in intelligent cockpit design to make intelligent cockpits provide better services for people.

Title: Application of Reinforcement Learning in Multiagent Intelligent Decision-Making.
Year: 2022
Authors: Han Xiaoyu
Abstract: The combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning had received more and more attention in recent years, and the attention of reinforcement learning of single agent was slowly getting transferred to multiagent. Regret minimization was a new concept in the theory of gaming. In some game issues that Nash equilibrium was not the optimal solution, the regret minimization had better performance. Herein, we introduce the regret minimization into multiagent reinforcement learning and propose a multiagent regret minimum algorithm. This chapter first introduces the Nash Q-learning algorithm and uses the overall framework of Nash Q-learning to minimize regrets into the multiagent reinforcement learning and then verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the experiment.

Title: Medical Intelligent System and Orthopedic Clinical Nursing Based on Graph Partition Sampling Algorithm.
Year: 2022
Authors: Heng Xiucheng, Chen Yufei, Liu Lihong
Abstract: This study summarizes the process of graph partition sampling algorithm. Through studying, observing, and comparing many different types of graph partition sampling algorithms, this study represents the learning process sampling into three steps: sampling process, aggregation process, and the calculation process of loss function. The medical intelligence system developed in this study must provide remote audio and video connections between patients, nurses, and doctors, and requires hardware, software, and network collaboration. The hardware includes a server that keeps the medical intelligence system running. The software includes the operating system and server application software that provide the basic functions of the system. The network platform provides network bandwidth and basic configuration to achieve effective connections between different parts. At the same time, the system also defines audio and video encoding and decoding standards. Orthopedic patients are often accompanied by varying degrees of activity limitation and low self-care ability, the particularity of these patients puts forward higher requirements for orthopedic clinical care management. Orthopedic clinical nursing path is a standardized nursing management method supported by evidence-based medicine. In order to meet the requirements of the system design, the goal of the system design is to use the latest computing and network communication technology to organically "connect" the nursing staff, the nursing staff, and the hospital, so that the nursing staff can enjoy the personalized guidance specially made by the doctor at any time.

Title: Estimates of lay views about reversal multiple intelligences for self and others: Sex and cross-cultural comparisons.
Year: 2017
Authors: Neto Félix, da Conceição Pinto Maria, Mullet Etienne, Furnham Adrian
Abstract: This study focuses on lay conceptions of intelligence. It examined sex and cross-cultural similarities and differences in estimated intelligences and beliefs about intelligence in two countries, Angola and East Timor, within the reversal theory framework. A total of 209 Angolan (109 women and 100 men) and 183 Timorese (89 women and 94 men) students were participated in this study. Participants completed a questionnaire in order to estimate their parents', partners' and own overall intelligence and the 8 reversal multiple intelligences (telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery and alloic sympathy intelligence). Respondents also rated 6 questions about intelligence. Men rated their overall, conformist and autic mastery higher than women. Angolans rated their overall, telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery and alloic sympathy intelligence higher than Timorese. In both countries, fathers have been perceived as more intelligent than mothers, and telic intelligence emerged as a significant predictor of overall intelligence. Principal component analysis of the 8 reversal multiple intelligences yielded one factor. Angolan participants revealed more IQ test experience than Timorese participants. Most of respondents in both countries did not believe in sex differences in intelligence. These findings are discussed by means of cross-cultural literature.

Title: Some Thoughts on Extended Collaboration of Entities with Natural and with Artificial Intelligence in Health Care and Beyond.
Year: 2019
Authors: Haux Reinhold
Abstract: This lecture is dealing with new, future forms of collaboration and with its (hopefully existing) extended synergies, which may now will come in our era of digitization. Entities in this collaboration are we, the human beings, and other living entities such as animals with 'natural intelligence' as well as non-living entities, in particular functionally comprehensive machines, with 'artificial intelligence'. Based on lessons learned during the last years, among others in a task force on synergy and intelligence (SYnENCE) of the Braunschweig Scientific Society, five consequences for future health care with respect to this collaboration are put for discussion: (1) functional comprehensive 'intelligent' machines should be regarded as entities, not as modalities, (2) such machines have to become users of information systems in health, in addition to human entities, appropriate (3) legal and (4) ethical frameworks have to be developed, (5) extended collaboration in medicine and health care needs to be evaluated in accordance with good scientific practice. The statements of Karl Jaspers, made in 1946 on medicine and on technology, may help us to find a good way.

Title: Touching the elephant: The search for fluid intelligence.
Year: 2017
Authors: Wasserman Theodore, Wasserman Lori Drucker
Abstract: Many constructs that we take for granted in modern neuropsychology, fluid intelligence among them, can best be explained by conceptionalizing them as a collection of task specific processes engaged in by an integrated recruited network involved in problem solving. Fractionalizing the network in an attempt to describe elements of its function leads to arbitrarily defined segments that may be interesting to discuss abstractly, but never occur independently in the real world operation of the system. We will seek to demonstrate that the construct of fluid intelligence is like that. It is a description of a type of operation of a network dedicated to solving problems and the composition of the network that is responsible for the activity changes in a task specific manner. As a result, fluid intelligence is not an independent skill, or a thing that lives on its own, or can be measured independently of the other things that contribute to the overall operation of the network as it seeks to solve problems.

Title: Emotional intelligence and psychopathy: a comparison of trait and ability measures.
Year: 2013
Authors: Copestake Sonja, Gray Nicola S, Snowden Robert J
Abstract: A dysfunction in the processing of emotional material has been suggested to underpin the concept of psychopathy, hence we hypothesized that individuals high in psychopathic traits should have low scores on measure of emotional intelligence (EI). We measured EI by using both an ability-based measure (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test) and a self-report measure (Trait Meta-Mood Scale) in a sample of offenders. Psychopathy was measured by using both a clinical checklist (Psychopathy Checklist-Revised) and a self-report scale (Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised). We also took a measure of intellectual ability (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) to assess any unique contribution from EI over that of IQ. We found that the concepts of EI (both ability-based and self-report) were related to IQ. We also found that there was a negative relationship between self-report EI and ability EI. In relation to psychopathy, the results did not support the hypotheses of a general deficit in EI. While the results relating different facets of psychopathy to different aspects of EI were complex, there was some evidence that some aspects of psychopathy were positively related to the unique variance related to EI once IQ was partialled out. We suggest that there is not a general deficit in EI in psychopathy, and that future research needs carefully to carefully consider just what aspects of psychopathy and of EI are being measured, and the influence of intellectual ability, before drawing conclusions on this matter.

Title: Emotionally intelligent people show more flexible regulation of emotions in daily life.
Year: 2022
Authors: Double Kit S, Pinkus Rebecca T, MacCann Carolyn
Abstract: Emotion regulation strategies have been characterized as adaptive or maladaptive; however, the ability to switch strategies to best suit the situation (regulatory flexibility and adaptability) underlies effective emotion regulation. Emotional intelligence may be a key capacity that enables flexible emotion regulation. We use experience sampling data from 165 participants to test whether emotional intelligence abilities (emotion understanding and management) predict variability in four emotion regulation strategies. Results show that both the emotion understanding and emotion management branches of emotional intelligence significantly relate to between-strategy variability (with moderate effect sizes), but only emotion understanding significantly predicts within-strategy variability. These findings support the hypothesis that emotional intelligence is an important predictor of the ability to flexibly vary emotion regulation depending on the situation.

Title: What is the Flynn Effect, and how does it change our understanding of IQ?
Year: 2017
Authors: Shenk David
Abstract: In 1981, psychologist James Flynn noticed that IQ scores had risen streadily over nearly a century a staggering difference of 18 points over two generations. After a careful analysis, he concluded the cause to be culture. Society had become more intelligent-come to grips with bigger, more abstract ideas over time-and had made people smarter. This observation, combined with solid evidence that IQ scores are also not fixed within an individual, neatly dispels the idea of intelligence being an innate and fixed entity. While intelligence clearly has a biological component, it is best defined, as a set of continually developed skills.

Title: The Timing of Evolutionary Transitions Suggests Intelligent Life is Rare.
Year: 2021
Authors: Snyder-Beattie Andrew E, Sandberg Anders, Drexler K Eric, Bonsall Michael B
Abstract: It is unknown how abundant extraterrestrial life is, or whether such life might be complex or intelligent. On Earth, the emergence of complex intelligent life required a preceding series of evolutionary transitions such as abiogenesis, eukaryogenesis, and the evolution of sexual reproduction, multicellularity, and intelligence itself. Some of these transitions could have been extraordinarily improbable, even in conducive environments. The emergence of intelligent life late in Earth's lifetime is thought to be evidence for a handful of rare evolutionary transitions, but the timing of other evolutionary transitions in the fossil record is yet to be analyzed in a similar framework. Using a simplified Bayesian model that combines uninformative priors and the timing of evolutionary transitions, we demonstrate that expected evolutionary transition times likely exceed the lifetime of Earth, perhaps by many orders of magnitude. Our results corroborate the original argument suggested by Brandon Carter that intelligent life in the Universe is exceptionally rare, assuming that intelligent life elsewhere requires analogous evolutionary transitions. Arriving at the opposite conclusion would require exceptionally conservative priors, evidence for much earlier transitions, multiple instances of transitions, or an alternative model that can explain why evolutionary transitions took hundreds of millions of years without appealing to rare chance events. Although the model is simple, it provides an initial basis for evaluating how varying biological assumptions and fossil record data impact the probability of evolving intelligent life, and also provides a number of testable predictions, such as that some biological paradoxes will remain unresolved and that planets orbiting M dwarf stars are uninhabitable.

Title: Understanding interdisciplinary perspectives of plant intelligence: Is it a matter of science, language, or subjectivity?
Year: 2022
Authors: Khattar Jennifer, Calvo Paco, Vandebroek Ina, Pandolfi Camilla, Dahdouh-Guebas Farid
Abstract: Evidence suggests that plants can behave intelligently by exhibiting the ability to learn, make associations between environmental cues, engage in complex decisions about resource acquisition, memorize, and adapt in flexible ways. However, plant intelligence is a disputed concept in the scientific community. Reasons for lack of consensus can be traced back to the history of Western philosophy, interpretation of terminology, and due to plants lacking neurons and a central nervous system. Plant intelligence thus constitutes a novel paradigm in the plant sciences. Therefore, the perspectives of scientists in plant-related disciplines need to be investigated in order to gain insight into the current state and future development of this concept.

Title: An Intelligent Waste-Sorting and Recycling Device Based on Improved EfficientNet.
Year: 2022
Authors: Feng Zhicheng, Yang Jie, Chen Lifang, Chen Zhichao, Li Linhong
Abstract: The main source of urban waste is the daily life activities of residents, and the waste sorting of residents' waste is important for promoting economic recycling, reducing labor costs, and protecting the environment. However, most residents are unable to make accurate judgments about the categories of household waste, which severely limits the efficiency of waste sorting. We have designed an intelligent waste bin that enables automatic waste sorting and recycling, avoiding the extensive knowledge required for waste sorting. To ensure that the waste-classification model is high accuracy and works in real time, GECM-EfficientNet is proposed based on EfficientNet by streamlining the mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv) module, introducing the efficient channel attention (ECA) module and coordinate attention (CA) module, and transfer learning. The accuracy of GECM-EfficientNet reaches 94.54% and 94.23% on the self-built household waste dataset and TrashNet dataset, with parameters of only 1.23 M. The time of one recognition on the intelligent waste bin is only 146 ms, which satisfies the real-time classification requirement. Our method improves the computational efficiency of the waste-classification model and simplifies the hardware requirements, which contributes to the residents' waste classification based on intelligent devices.

Title: The Innovation of College Students' Ideological and Political Education under the Intelligent Environment of Internet of Things.
Year: 2022
Authors: Wang Xia
Abstract: With the development of the times and the continuous improvement of the requirements for college students' political literacy and identity, the informatization reform and educational innovation of college students' ideological and political education have become the focus and difficulty of teaching reform. The ideological and political education in most domestic colleges and universities still focuses on the elaboration of theoretical knowledge, ignoring the importance of social practice. Therefore, this paper puts forward the research on the innovation of college students' ideological and political education in the intelligent environment of the Internet of things, constructs the college ideological and political education training cloud system through the Internet of Things technology and AR technology, and promotes the realization of the purpose of college students' participation in social practice. The experimental results show that the college ideological and political education training cloud system based on AR and Internet of Things technology can improve the interaction and participation of ideological and political courses, stimulate students' interest and enthusiasm, deepen students' understanding of the content of ideological and political education, and better understand the importance of ideological and political education. At the same time, the system is also the exploration and practice of teaching innovation of ideological and political education in the intelligent environment of Internet of Things. It is a new attempt of ideological and political education reform in colleges and universities.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Human Enhancement: Can AI Technologies Make Us More (Artificially) Intelligent?
Year: 2024
Authors: Nyholm Sven
Abstract: This paper discusses two opposing views about the relation between artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence: on the one hand, a worry that heavy reliance on AI technologies might make people less intelligent and, on the other, a hope that AI technologies might serve as a form of cognitive enhancement. The worry relates to the notion that if we hand over too many intelligence-requiring tasks to AI technologies, we might end up with fewer opportunities to train our own intelligence. Concerning AI as a potential form of cognitive enhancement, the paper explores two possibilities: (1) AI as extending-and thereby enhancing-people's minds, and (2) AI as enabling people to behave in artificially intelligent ways. That is, using AI technologies might enable people to behave as if they have been cognitively enhanced. The paper considers such enhancements both on the level of individuals and on the level of groups.

Title: Research on Intelligent Monitoring of Boring Bar Vibration State Based on Shuffle-BiLSTM.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Qiang, Li Dingkun, Ma Jing, Bai Zhengyan, Liu Jiaqi
Abstract: Due to its low stiffness, the boring bar used in deep-hole-boring is prone to violent vibration during the cutting process. It is often inaccurate and inefficient to judge the vibration state of the boring bar through artificial experience. To detect the change of the vibration state of the boring bar over time, guide the adjustment of the processing parameters, and avoid wastage of the workpiece and the loss of equipment, it is particularly important to intelligently monitor the vibration state of the boring bar during processing. In this paper, the boring bar is taken as the research object, and an intelligent monitoring technology of the boring bar's vibration state based on deep learning is proposed. Based on grouping convolution, channel shuffle, and BiLSTM, a shuffle-BiLSTM NET model is constructed, which is both lightweight and has a high classification accuracy. The boring experiment platform is built, and 192 groups of cutting experiments are carried out. The three-way acceleration and sound pressure signals are collected, and the signals are processed by smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution. The original signals are transformed into a 256 × 256 × 3 matrix obtained by a two-dimensional time-frequency spectrum diagram. The matrix is input into the model to recognize the boring bar's vibration state. The final classification accuracy is 91.2%. A variety of typical deep learning models are introduced for performance comparison, which proves the superiority of the models and methods used in this paper.

Title: Equipment Identification and Localization Method Based on Improved YOLOv5s Model for Production Line.
Year: 2022
Authors: Yu Ming, Wan Qian, Tian Songling, Hou Yanyan, Wang Yimiao, Zhao Jian
Abstract: Intelligent video surveillance based on artificial intelligence, image processing, and other advanced technologies is a hot topic of research in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Currently, low recognition accuracy and low location precision of devices in intelligent monitoring remain a problem in production lines. This paper proposes a production line device recognition and localization method based on an improved YOLOv5s model. The proposed method can achieve real-time detection and localization of production line equipment such as robotic arms and AGV carts by introducing CA attention module in YOLOv5s network model architecture, GSConv lightweight convolution method and Slim-Neck method in Neck layer, add Decoupled Head structure to the Detect layer. The experimental results show that the improved method achieves 93.6% Precision, 85.6% recall, and 91.8% mAP@0.5, and the Pascal VOC2007 public dataset test shows that the improved method effectively improves the recognition accuracy. The research results can substantially improve the intelligence level of production lines and provide an important reference for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent and digital transformation.

Title: Load Balancing Using Artificial Intelligence for Cloud-Enabled Internet of Everything in Healthcare Domain.
Year: 2023
Authors: Aqeel Ibrahim, Khormi Ibrahim Mohsen, Khan Surbhi Bhatia, Shuaib Mohammed, Almusharraf Ahlam, Alam Shadab, Alkhaldi Nora A
Abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its subsequent evolution into the Internet of Everything (IoE) is a result of the rapid growth of information and communication technologies (ICT). However, implementing these technologies comes with certain obstacles, such as the limited availability of energy resources and processing power. Consequently, there is a need for energy-efficient and intelligent load-balancing models, particularly in healthcare, where real-time applications generate large volumes of data. This paper proposes a novel, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI)-based load balancing model that employs the Chaotic Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm (CHROA) and big data analytics (BDA) for cloud-enabled IoT environments. The CHROA technique enhances the optimization capacity of the Horse Ride Optimization Algorithm (HROA) using chaotic principles. The proposed CHROA model balances the load, optimizes available energy resources using AI techniques, and is evaluated using various metrics. Experimental results show that the CHROA model outperforms existing models. For instance, while the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Whale Defense Algorithm with Firefly Algorithm (WD-FA) techniques attain average throughputs of 58.247 Kbps, 59.957 Kbps, and 60.819 Kbps, respectively, the CHROA model achieves an average throughput of 70.122 Kbps. The proposed CHROA-based model presents an innovative approach to intelligent load balancing and energy optimization in cloud-enabled IoT environments. The results highlight its potential to address critical challenges and contribute to developing efficient and sustainable IoT/IoE solutions.

Title: Brief review of fluid reasoning: Conceptualization, neurobasis, and applications.
Year: 2017
Authors: Otero Tulio M
Abstract: In the early part of the twentieth century the value of nonverbal tests was initially recognized by Yoakum and Yerkes when they wrote how examinees could fail a verbal test of general ability because of limited skills in English. When these examinees were then tested with a nonverbal test of ability, they often performed well, and therefore this approach avoided "injustice by reason of relative unfamiliarity with English." Measuring cognitive ability with nonverbal measures that do not require verbal skills has been supported now for nearly a century. Research has demonstrated that a person's general ability can be measured validly and reliably without requiring the student to read, write, or speak. The neuroanatomical and neuro-anatomical basis for FR is well established and focuses on the frontal-parietal system, and the use of FR measures is a common practice. In this brief article the current conceptualization of Fluid Reasoning (FR) is examined, I suggest how popular used constructs on other common cognitive tests can be conceptualized as a variant of FR. Then, the general neuroanatomical substrates and networks are revisited, followed by summarizing some of the practical scenarios for measuring FR may be useful.

Title: High intelligence prevents the negative impact of anxiety on working memory.
Year: 2015
Authors: Chuderski Adam
Abstract: Using a large sample and the confirmatory factor analysis, the study investigated the relationships between anxiety, working memory (WM) and (fluid) intelligence. The study showed that the negative impact of anxiety on WM functioning diminishes with increasing intelligence, and that anxiety can significantly affect WM only in people below average intelligence. This effect could not be fully explained by the sheer differences in WM capacity (WMC), suggesting the importance of higher-level cognition in coping with anxiety. Although intelligence moderated the impact of anxiety on WM, it was only weakly related to anxiety. In contrast to previous studies, anxiety explained the substantial amount of WMC variance (17.8%) in less intelligent participants, but none of the variance in more intelligent ones. These results can be explained in terms of either increased motivation of intelligent but anxious people to cope with a WM task, or their ability to compensate decrements in WM.

Title: Gender and gender role differences in self- and other-estimates of multiple intelligences.
Year: 2013
Authors: Szymanowicz Agata, Furnham Adrian
Abstract: This study examined participant gender and gender role differences in estimates of multiple intelligences for self, partner, and various hypothetical, stereotypical, and counter-stereotypical target persons. A general population sample of 261 British participants completed one of four questionnaires that required them to estimate their own and others' multiple intelligences and personality traits. Males estimated their general IQ slightly, but mathematic IQ significantly higher than females, who rated their social and emotional intelligence higher than males. Masculine individuals awarded themselves somewhat higher verbal and practical IQ scores than did female participants. Both participant gender and gender role differences in IQ estimates were found, with gender effects stronger in cognitive and gender role than in "personal" ability estimates. There was a significant effect of gender role on hypothetical persons' intelligence evaluations, with masculine targets receiving significantly higher intelligence estimates compared to feminine targets. More intelligent hypothetical figures were judged as more masculine and less feminine than less intelligent ones.

Title: [Artificial intelligence for future MD].
Year: 2018
Authors: Sancipriano Gian Piero, Buttafarro Marinella
Abstract: Health care workers need artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a set of studies and techniques that tend to the realization of machines, which solve complex problems automatically, simulating or emulating human intelligence activities. Human intelligence is innate, creative, emotional, sporting, social in the collective and connected future. Knowledge is the faculty, act, mode, effect of taking possession, intellectually or psychologically, with systematic activity of any certain aspect of reality. The dates are given in the form of text, number, symbol, image, sounds that are used or stored in computers. Having many data or data does not mean having much information. Having a lot of information does not mean having a lot of knowledge. Symbolic reasoning uses symbolic logic, logical connectives, expert systems, production rules, genetic algorithms, validation, explanation, justification, verification of inference, heuristic research. The knowledge of symbolic reasoning is deterministic. Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed to do so. Use algorithms for statistical and probability calculations, the learning phases may not be verifiable. They are mathematically structured human opinions, spoiled by the pre -understandings of those who design them, of those who want to look for something. The association between symbolic reasoning and automatic learning is excellent. The intelligence of health workers work connected and collective, develop knowledge bases to be subjected to symbolic reasoning, expert systems and rules to have deterministic knowledge. The deterministic knowledge subsequently elaborated by artificial intelligence will be returned to human intelligences.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have found many useful applications in recent years. Of particular interest have been those instances where their successes imitate human cognition and many consider artificial intelligences to offer a lens for understanding human intelligence. Here, we criticize the underlying conflation between the predictive and explanatory power of DNNs by examining the goals of modeling.

Title: A neurodynamic approach for nonsmooth optimal power consumption of intelligent and connected vehicles.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Jingxin, Liao Xiaofeng, Dong Jin-Song, Mansoori Amin
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of power consumption minimization and equalization for intelligent and connected vehicles cooperative system. Accordingly, a distributed optimization problem model related to power consumption and data rate of intelligent and connected vehicles is presented, where the power consumption cost function of each intelligent and connected vehicle may be nonsmooth, and the corresponding control variable is subject to the constraints generated by data acquisition, compression coding, transmission and reception. We propose a distributed subgradient-based neurodynamic approach with projection operator to achieve the optimal power consumption of intelligent and connected vehicles. By differential inclusion and nonsmooth analysis, it is confirmed that the state solution of neurodynamic system converges to the optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem. With the help of the algorithm, all intelligent and connected vehicles asymptotically reach a consensus on an optimal power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed neurodynamic approach is capable of effectively solving the problem of power consumption optimal control for intelligent and connected vehicles cooperative system.

Title: The Moderating Influence of School Achievement on Intelligence in Young Adulthood.
Year: 2021
Authors: Hegelund Emilie Rune, Mortensen Erik Lykke, Flensborg-Madsen Trine, Dammeyer Jesper, Christensen Kaare, Johnson Wendy
Abstract: Education has been suggested to be possibly the most consistent, robust, and durable method available for raising intelligence, but little is known about the genetic and environmental interplay underlying this association. Therefore, we investigated how school achievement, as measured by grade point average in lower secondary school at 15 years of age, moderated intelligence variation in young adulthood. The sample consisted of all Danish male twin pairs who had left lower secondary school since 2002 and appeared, typically at age 18, before a draft board through 2015 (N = 2660). Shared environmental variance unique to intelligence (10% of total variance) was found to be greater among individuals with poor school achievement. However, school achievement did not moderate the genetic influences or the non-shared environmental influences on intelligence. We discuss the implications of this in light of the constraints imposed by the statistical models we used.

Title: Complex variation in measures of general intelligence and cognitive change.
Year: 2013
Authors: Rowe Suzanne J, Rowlatt Amy, Davies Gail, Harris Sarah E, Porteous David J, Liewald David C, McNeill Geraldine, Starr John M, Deary Ian J, Tenesa Albert
Abstract: Combining information from multiple SNPs may capture a greater amount of genetic variation than from the sum of individual SNP effects and help identifying missing heritability. Regions may capture variation from multiple common variants of small effect, multiple rare variants or a combination of both. We describe regional heritability mapping of human cognition. Measures of crystallised (gc) and fluid intelligence (gf) in late adulthood (64-79 years) were available for 1806 individuals genotyped for 549,692 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The same individuals were tested at age 11, enabling us the rare opportunity to measure cognitive change across most of their lifespan. 547,750 SNPs ranked by position are divided into 10, 908 overlapping regions of 101 SNPs to estimate the genetic variance each region explains, an approach that resembles classical linkage methods. We also estimate the genetic variation explained by individual autosomes and by SNPs within genes. Empirical significance thresholds are estimated separately for each trait from whole genome scans of 500 permutated data sets. The 5% significance threshold for the likelihood ratio test of a single region ranged from 17-17.5 for the three traits. This is the equivalent to nominal significance under the expectation of a chi-squared distribution (between 1 df and 0) of P<1.44×10(-5). These thresholds indicate that the distribution of the likelihood ratio test from this type of variance component analysis should be estimated empirically. Furthermore, we show that estimates of variation explained by these regions can be grossly overestimated. After applying permutation thresholds, a region for gf on chromosome 5 spanning the PRRC1 gene is significant at a genome-wide 10% empirical threshold. Analysis of gene methylation on the temporal cortex provides support for the association of PRRC1 and fluid intelligence (P = 0.004), and provides a prime candidate gene for high throughput sequencing of these uniquely informative cohorts.

Title: A Novel Markov Model-Based Traffic Density Estimation Technique for Intelligent Transportation System.
Year: 2023
Authors: Beenish Hira, Javid Tariq, Fahad Muhammad, Siddiqui Adnan Ahmed, Ahmed Ghufran, Syed Hassan Jamil
Abstract: An intelligent transportation system (ITS) aims to improve traffic efficiency by integrating innovative sensing, control, and communications technologies. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and Industrial Revolution 4.0 recently merged to design the industrial Internet of things-intelligent transportation system (IIoT-ITS). IIoT sensing technologies play a significant role in acquiring raw data. The application continuously performs the complex task of managing traffic flows effectively based on several parameters, including the number of vehicles in the system, their location, and time. Traffic density estimation (TDE) is another important derived parameter desirable to keep track of the dynamic state of traffic volume. The expanding number of vehicles based on wireless connectivity provides new potential to predict traffic density more accurately and in real time as previously used methodologies. We explore the topic of assessing traffic density by using only a few simple metrics, such as the number of surrounding vehicles and disseminating beacons to roadside units and vice versa. This research paper investigates TDE techniques and presents a novel Markov model-based TDE technique for ITS. Finally, an OMNET++-based approach with an implementation of a significant modification of a traffic model combined with mathematical modeling of the Markov model is presented. It is intended for the study of real-world traffic traces, the identification of model parameters, and the development of simulated traffic.

Authors: Lu Yuan
Abstract: Primarily based on theoretical studies of multicultural pedagogy, anthropology of music, and postmodern music education concepts, techniques combining qualitative and quantitative research are used. Eight types of design guidelines are then proposed according to different intelligence characteristics, according to intelligence characteristics and context of conversational design. Finally, based on the perspective of multicultural learning environments, this work will explore and provide insights into new concepts of piano teaching in multicultural learning environments in three areas: new piano teaching, new instruction, and new piano learning materials. The experimental results show that piano teaching activities based on multiple intelligences theory can stimulate students' interest in learning music, fully mobilize students' initiative in learning music, and improve the quality of music teaching.

Title: Artificial Neural Network Model for Indoor Decoration Intelligence Calculation and Automation Design.
Year: 2022
Authors: Li Yan
Abstract: With the continuous development of science and technology, the indoor decoration industry has gradually changed toward mechanization, specialization, and intelligent direction. Based on the predecessor research, this study proposes an artificial neural network model for indoor decoration intelligence calculation and automation design. Based on scales, walls, doors, windows, and other specific components, digital image processing technology implements automatic identification of the apartment graph and completes the preprocessing of the floor plan map. Combined with the indoor decoration data set, the automated design model based on an artificial neural network is established, and the network structure and training process of the model are analyzed. Finally, the bedroom and the living room were experimentally designed. The results showed that as the number of training increased to 30 times, the MAE and MSE assessment indicators gradually decreased, and the error of the model was very small and gradually stabilized. This shows that artificial neural network automation design is better; second, artificial neural network algorithms can generate multiple layout schemes within 1 minute. The design layout is efficient and the plan is reasonable. It meets all requests such as circulation, openness, lighting, and functionality, saving a lot of human and time and providing users with more choices.

Title: Multi-graph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks with pseudo-label supervision.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yang Yachao, Sun Yanfeng, Ju Fujiao, Wang Shaofan, Gao Junbin, Yin Baocai
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become a popular tool for learning unstructured graph data due to their powerful learning ability. Many researchers have been interested in fusing topological structures and node features to extract the correlation information for classification tasks. However, it is inadequate to integrate the embedding from topology and feature spaces to gain the most correlated information. At the same time, most GCN-based methods assume that the topology graph or feature graph is compatible with the properties of GCNs, but this is usually not satisfied since meaningless, missing, or even unreal edges are very common in actual graphs. To obtain a more robust and accurate graph structure, we intend to construct an adaptive graph with topology and feature graphs. We propose Multi-graph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks with pseudo-label supervision (MFGCN), which learn a connected embedding by fusing the multi-graphs and node features. We can obtain the final node embedding for semi-supervised node classification by propagating node features over multi-graphs. Furthermore, to alleviate the problem of labels missing in semi-supervised classification, a pseudo-label generation mechanism is proposed to generate more reliable pseudo-labels based on the similarity of node features. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MFGCN over state-of-the-art classification methods.

Title: Gray matter correlates of creative potential: a latent variable voxel-based morphometry study.
Year: 2015
Authors: Jauk Emanuel, Neubauer Aljoscha C, Dunst Beate, Fink Andreas, Benedek Mathias
Abstract: There is increasing research interest in the structural and functional brain correlates underlying creative potential. Recent investigations found that interindividual differences in creative potential relate to volumetric differences in brain regions belonging to the default mode network, such as the precuneus. Yet, the complex interplay between creative potential, intelligence, and personality traits and their respective neural bases is still under debate. We investigated regional gray matter volume (rGMV) differences that can be associated with creative potential in a heterogeneous sample of N=135 individuals using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). By means of latent variable modeling and consideration of recent psychometric advancements in creativity research, we sought to disentangle the effects of ideational originality and fluency as two independent indicators of creative potential. Intelligence and openness to experience were considered as common covariates of creative potential. The results confirmed and extended previous research: rGMV in the precuneus was associated with ideational originality, but not with ideational fluency. In addition, we found ideational originality to be correlated with rGMV in the caudate nucleus. The results indicate that the ability to produce original ideas is tied to default-mode as well as dopaminergic structures. These structural brain correlates of ideational originality were apparent throughout the whole range of intellectual ability and thus not moderated by intelligence. In contrast, structural correlates of ideational fluency, a quantitative marker of creative potential, were observed only in lower intelligent individuals in the cuneus/lingual gyrus.

Title: Empathic responsiveness of children and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.
Year: 2013
Authors: Scheeren Anke M, Koot Hans M, Mundy Peter C, Mous Larissa, Begeer Sander
Abstract: Previous studies have shown reduced empathic responsiveness to others' emotions in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and an intellectual disability. However, age and intelligence may promote children's empathic responsiveness. Therefore, we examined the empathic responsiveness in normally intelligent school-aged children and adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 151) and in a typically developing comparison group (n = 50), using structured observations and parent reports. Based on the observations, participants' responses to the emotional displays of an interviewer were surprisingly similar. However, compared with parents from the comparison group, parents of a child with ASD reported significantly fewer empathic responses, particularly when the child received a high score on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Even though parents report a reduced empathic responsiveness in school-aged children and adolescents with ASD, it may be difficult to find these empathic limitations during brief observations in a structured setting.

Title: On the nature and nurture of intelligence and specific cognitive abilities: the more heritable, the more culture dependent.
Year: 2013
Authors: Kan Kees-Jan, Wicherts Jelte M, Dolan Conor V, van der Maas Han L J
Abstract: To further knowledge concerning the nature and nurture of intelligence, we scrutinized how heritability coefficients vary across specific cognitive abilities both theoretically and empirically. Data from 23 twin studies (combined N = 7,852) showed that (a) in adult samples, culture-loaded subtests tend to demonstrate greater heritability coefficients than do culture-reduced subtests; and (b) in samples of both adults and children, a subtest's proportion of variance shared with general intelligence is a function of its cultural load. These findings require an explanation because they do not follow from mainstream theories of intelligence. The findings are consistent with our hypothesis that heritability coefficients differ across cognitive abilities as a result of differences in the contribution of genotype-environment covariance. The counterintuitive finding that the most heritable abilities are the most culture-dependent abilities sheds a new light on the long-standing nature-nurture debate of intelligence.

Title: When intelligence hurts and ignorance is bliss: Global pandemic as an evolutionarily novel threat to happiness.
Year: 2022
Authors: Kanazawa Satoshi, Li Norman P, Yong Jose C
Abstract: The savanna theory of happiness posits that it is not only the current consequences of a given situation that affect happiness but also its ancestral consequences, and that the effect of ancestral consequences on happiness is stronger among less intelligent individuals. But what about situations that did not exist in the ancestral environment and thus have no ancestral consequences? Global pandemic is one such situation that has no ancestral analog, and the theory predicts such evolutionarily novel threats to have a negative effect disproportionately on the life satisfaction of more intelligent individuals.

Year: 2022
Authors: Guan Zixi, Pamba Raja Varma, Balachander Bhuvaneswari, Khare Deepak Kumar, Deb Nabamita, Boddu Rajasekhar
Abstract: This paper introduces the application and classification of an adaptive filtering algorithm in the image enhancement algorithm. And the filtering noise reduction impact is compared using MATLAB software for programming, image processing, LMS algorithm, RLS algorithm, histogram equalisation algorithm, and Wiener filtering method filtering noise reduction effect. To optimize the intelligent graphic image interaction system, the proposed nonlinear adaptive algorithm of intelligent graphic image interaction system research is based on the digital filter and adaptive filtering algorithm for simulation experiment. The experimental results of several noise index data filtering algorithms show that the fuzzy coefficient <i>k</i> of LMS index is 0.86, RLS index is 0.91, the histogram equalization index is 0.53, and the Wiener filtering index is 0.62. LMS index of quality index <i>Q</i> is 0.90, RLS index is 0.95, histogram equalization index is 0.58, Wiener filtering index is 0.65. According to the above results, comparing LMS with the RLS method and according to SNR, <i>k</i>, and <i>Q</i> values in the simulation results in the process of processing, it is found that the convergence speed of the RLS algorithm is obviously better than that of the LMS algorithm, and the stability is also good. Additionally, the differential imaging data can provide a strong reference for the clinical diagnosis and qualitative differentiation of TBP and CP, and MSCT is worthy of extensive application in the clinical diagnosis of peritonitis. The processing effect of the image with high similarity to the original image is greatly improved compared with the histogram equalization and Wiener filtering methods used in the simulation.

Title: Catastrophe risk can accelerate unlikely evolutionary transitions.
Year: 2022
Authors: Snyder-Beattie Andrew E, Bonsall Michael B
Abstract: Intelligent life has emerged late in Earth's habitable lifetime, and required a preceding series of key evolutionary transitions. A simple model (the Carter model) explains the late arrival of intelligent life by positing these evolutionary transitions were exceptionally unlikely 'critical steps'. An alternative model (the neocatastrophism hypothesis) proposes that intelligent life was delayed by frequent catastrophes that served to set back evolutionary innovation. Here, we generalize the Carter model and explore this hypothesis by including catastrophes that can 'undo' an evolutionary transition. Introducing catastrophes or evolutionary dead ends can create situations in which critical steps occur rapidly or in clusters, suggesting that past estimates of the number of critical steps could be underestimated. If catastrophes affect complex life more than simple life, the critical steps will also exhibit a pattern of acceleration towards the present, suggesting that the increase in biological complexity over the past 500 Myr could reflect previously overlooked evolutionary transitions. Furthermore, our results have implications for understanding the different explanations (critical steps versus neo-catastrophes) for the evolution of intelligent life and the so-called Fermi paradox-the observation that intelligent life appears rare in the observable Universe.

Title: Impact of Physical Activity Practice and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet in Relation to Multiple Intelligences among University Students.
Year: 2020
Authors: Ubago-Jiménez José Luis, Zurita-Ortega Félix, San Román-Mata Silvia, Puertas-Molero Pilar, González-Valero Gabriel
Abstract: Physical activity is important at any time of life. Particularly in the university, people tend to have more sedentary life, due to their studies. Eating habits are another health factor to consider. In addition, the Multiple Intelligences theory is a proposal that seeks the integral development and well-being of people. A descriptive, cross-sectional, and non-experimental research with the purpose of this study is to establish the relationships between practice of physical activity and the intelligences and determine the relationship between diet and the different types of intelligence in 215 university students. Findings indicate higher adherence to Mediterranean Diet in women and higher physical activity scores in men. Regarding multiple intelligences, men have higher indices in Bodily-kinesthetic, Interpersonal, Logical-mathematical, Musical, and Spatial intelligences, while women show higher levels in relation to Linguistic, Intrapersonal, and Naturalistic intelligences. Main conclusions from this study suggest the relationship between multiple intelligence and healthy habits, while also highlighting the need to improve eating habits and achieve greater adherence to Mediterranean Diet.

Title: End-to-End Autonomous Exploration with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Intrinsic Motivation.
Year: 2021
Authors: Ruan Xiaogang, Li Peng, Zhu Xiaoqing, Yu Hejie, Yu Naigong
Abstract: Developing artificial intelligence (AI) agents is challenging for efficient exploration in visually rich and complex environments. In this study, we formulate the exploration question as a reinforcement learning problem and rely on intrinsic motivation to guide exploration behavior. Such intrinsic motivation is driven by curiosity and is calculated based on episode memory. To distribute the intrinsic motivation, we use a count-based method and temporal distance to generate it synchronously. We tested our approach in 3D maze-like environments and validated its performance in exploration tasks through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our agent can learn exploration ability from raw sensory input and accomplish autonomous exploration across different mazes. In addition, the learned policy is not biased by stochastic objects. We also analyze the effects of different training methods and driving forces on exploration policy.

Title: LightFD: Real-Time Fault Diagnosis with Edge Intelligence for Power Transformers.
Year: 2022
Authors: Fu Xinhua, Yang Kejun, Liu Min, Xing Tianzhang, Wu Chase
Abstract: Power fault monitoring based on acoustic waves has gained a great deal of attention in industry. Existing methods for fault diagnosis typically collect sound signals on site and transmit them to a back-end server for analysis, which may fail to provide a real-time response due to transmission packet loss and latency. However, the limited computing power of edge devices and the existing methods for feature extraction pose a significant challenge to performing diagnosis on the edge. In this paper, we propose a fast Lightweight Fault Diagnosis method for power transformers, referred to as LightFD, which integrates several technical components. Firstly, before feature extraction, we design an asymmetric Hamming-cosine window function to reduce signal spectrum leakage and ensure data integrity. Secondly, we design a multidimensional spatio-temporal feature extraction method to extract acoustic features. Finally, we design a parallel dual-layer, dual-channel lightweight neural network to realize the classification of different fault types on edge devices with limited computing power. Extensive simulation and experimental results show that the diagnostic precision and recall of LightFD reach 94.64% and 95.33%, which represent an improvement of 4% and 1.6% over the traditional SVM method, respectively.

Title: An evaluation model for automobile intelligent cockpit comfort based on improved combination weighting-cloud model.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yang Jianjun, Wan Qilin, Han Jiahao, Xing Shanshan
Abstract: Aiming at the comfort evaluation of automobile intelligent cockpit, an evaluation model based on improved combination weighting-cloud model is established. By consulting relevant literature, 4 first-class indexes and 15 second-class indexes, including noise and vibration, light environment, thermal environment and human-computer interaction, are selected to establish a comfort evaluation system. Later the subjective and objective weights obtained by improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are combined by Game Theory. Considering the fuzziness and randomness of the index system, the combination weights obtained by Game Theory are combined with the cloud model. The floating cloud algorithms is used to determine the first-class and second-class index clouds and the comprehensive evaluation cloud parameters. Improvements were made in two commonly used similarity calculation methods, the expectation curve method (ECM) and the maximum boundary curve method (MCM). A new similarity calculation method is defined to optimize the evaluation results and determine the final comfort evaluation grade. Lastly, a 2021 Audi intelligent car under a certain working condition was selected to verify the correctness and rationality of the model using the fuzzy evaluation method. The results show that the cockpit comfort evaluation model based on the improved combination weighting-cloud model can better reflect the comprehensive comfort of automobile cockpit.

Title: Architecture of cognitive flexibility revealed by lesion mapping.
Year: 2013
Authors: Barbey Aron K, Colom Roberto, Grafman Jordan
Abstract: Neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding the architecture of human intelligence, identifying a distributed network of brain structures that support goal-directed, intelligent behavior. However, the neural foundations of cognitive flexibility and adaptive aspects of intellectual function remain to be well characterized. Here, we report a human lesion study (n=149) that investigates the neural bases of key competencies of cognitive flexibility (i.e., mental flexibility and the fluent generation of new ideas) and systematically examine their contributions to a broad spectrum of cognitive and social processes, including psychometric intelligence (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence (Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), and personality (Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory). Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain error-free indices of each factor, followed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. Regression analyses revealed that latent scores for psychometric intelligence reliably predict latent scores for cognitive flexibility (adjusted R(2)=0.94). Lesion mapping results further indicated that these convergent processes depend on a shared network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, including white matter association tracts, which bind these areas into an integrated system. A targeted analysis of the unique variance explained by cognitive flexibility further revealed selective damage within the right superior temporal gyrus, a region known to support insight and the recognition of novel semantic relations. The observed findings motivate an integrative framework for understanding the neural foundations of adaptive behavior, suggesting that core elements of cognitive flexibility emerge from a distributed network of brain regions that support specific competencies for human intelligence.

Title: SmartSPR sensor: Machine learning approaches to create intelligent surface plasmon based sensors.
Year: 2021
Authors: Gomes Julio Cartier M, Souza Leandro Carlos, Oliveira Leiva Casemiro
Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensors allow the evaluation of aqueous and gaseous solutions from real-time measurements of molecular interactions. The reliability of the response generated by a SPR sensor must be guaranteed, especially in substance detection, diagnoses, and other routine applications since poorly handled samples, instrumentation noise features, or even molecular tampering manipulations can lead to wrong interpretations. This work investigates the use of different machine learning (ML) techniques to deal with these issues, and aim to improve and attest to the quality of the real-time SPR responses so-called sensorgrams. A new strategy to describe a SPR-sensorgram is shown. The results of the proposed ML-approach allow the creation of intelligent SPR sensors to give a safe, reliable, and auditable analysis of sensorgram responses. Our arrangement can be embedded in an Intelligence Module that can classify sensorgrams and identify the substances presents in it. Also made it possible to order and analyze interest areas of sensorgrams, standardizing data, and supporting eventual audit procedures. With those intelligence features, the new generation of SPR-intelligent biosensors is qualifying to perform automated testing. A properly protocol for Leishmaniasis diagnosis with SPR was used to verify this new feature.

Title: Application of Intraoperative Electromyography Intelligent Monitoring in Orthopedic Surgery under General Anesthesia.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Mingmin, Duan Junfeng, Chen Yanchun, Zhang Chunyu
Abstract: To study the application of intraoperative EMG intelligent monitoring in orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia, a total of 53 patients who underwent orthopedic surgery from February 2021 to February 2022 were selected. The combined monitoring of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), motor evoked potential (MEP), and electromyography (EMG) was used to analyze the monitoring efficiency. In 38 of the 53 patients, the intraoperative signal was normal, and there was no postoperative neurological dysfunction; one case had abnormal signal, and the abnormality still existed after debugging, but no obvious neurological dysfunction was found after operation; the remaining 14 cases had abnormal signal. There were 13 early warnings in SEP monitoring; 12 early warnings in MEP monitoring; 10 early warnings in EMG monitoring. There were 15 cases of early warning in the joint monitoring of the three, and the sensitivity of the combined monitoring of SEP + MEP + EMG was significantly higher than that of the single monitoring of SEP, MEP, and EMG (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There was no significant difference in specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value between combined monitoring and single monitoring (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The combined monitoring of EMG, MEP, and SEP in orthopedic surgery can significantly improve the safety of surgery, its sensitivity and negative predictive value were significantly higher than the monitoring effects of the two alone.

Title: Vision-Based Intelligent Perceiving and Planning System of a 7-DoF Collaborative Robot.
Year: 2021
Authors: Xu Linfeng, Li Gang, Song Peiheng, Shao Weixiang
Abstract: In this paper, an intelligent perceiving and planning system based on deep learning is proposed for a collaborative robot consisting of a 7-DoF (7-degree-of-freedom) manipulator, a three-finger robot hand, and a vision system, known as IPPS (intelligent perceiving and planning system). The lack of intelligence has been limiting the application of collaborative robots for a long time. A system to realize "eye-brain-hand" process is crucial for the true intelligence of robots. In this research, a more stable and accurate perceiving process was proposed. A well-designed camera system as the vision system and a new hand tracking method were proposed for operation perceiving and recording set establishment to improve the applicability. A visual process was designed to improve the accuracy of environment perceiving. Besides, a faster and more precise planning process was proposed. Deep learning based on a new CNN (convolution neural network) was designed to realize intelligent grasping planning for robot hand. A new trajectory planning method of the manipulator was proposed to improve efficiency. The performance of the IPPS was tested with simulations and experiments in a real environment. The results show that IPPS could effectively realize intelligent perceiving and planning for the robot, which could realize higher intelligence and great applicability for collaborative robots.

Title: Attachment and socio-emotional skills: a comparison of depressed inpatients, institutionalized delinquents and control adolescents.
Year: 2013
Authors: Delhaye Marie, Kempenaers Chantal, Stroobants Rob, Goossens Luc, Linkowski Paul
Abstract: This study compared 50 depressed inpatients, 51 institutionalized delinquents and 51 control adolescents (total n = 152) regarding attachment and associated socio-emotional skills. All of the participants took an individual interview (i.e., anamnesis, diagnostic interview and intelligence test) and completed the attachment measure and self-report measures of socio-emotional skills (i.e., emotional intelligence, empathy and resilience). Results showed that controls scored higher on secure attachment, whereas both of the other groups scored higher on preoccupied attachment. Depressed adolescents had lower scores on emotional intelligence than did controls. Finally, depressed adolescents had lower scores than the other two groups on resilience. The anxious or preoccupied attachment in both clinical groups, the overall frailty of depressive adolescents and the apparent resilience of delinquent adolescents despite their cognitive limitations should inform the respective treatment plans for these groups of adolescents. Suggestions for future research into differences between depressed and delinquent adolescents are outlined.

Title: Learning dynamic spatial-temporal regularized correlation filter tracking with response deviation suppression via multi-feature fusion.
Year: 2023
Authors: Moorthy Sathishkumar, Joo Young Hoon
Abstract: Visual object tracking (VOT) for intelligent video surveillance has attracted great attention in the current research community, thanks to advances in computer vision and camera technology. Meanwhile, discriminative correlation filter (DCF) trackers garnered significant interest owing to their high accuracy and low computing cost. Many researchers have introduced spatial and temporal regularization into the DCF framework to achieve a more robust appearance model and further improve tracking performance. However, these algorithms typically set fixed spatial and temporal regularization parameters, which limit flexibility and adaptability under cluttered and challenging scenarios. To overcome these problems, in this work, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal regularization for the DCF tracking model that emphasizes the filter to concentrate on more reliable regions during the training stage. Furthermore, we present a response deviation-suppressed regularization term for responses to encourage temporal consistency and avoid model degradation by suppressing relative response changes between two consecutive frames. Moreover, we introduce a multi-memory tracking framework to exploit various features and each memory contributes to tracking the target across all frames. Significant experiments on the OTB-2013, OTB-2015, TC-128, UAV-123, UAVDT, and DTB-70 datasets have revealed that the performance thereof outperformed many state-of-the-art trackers based on DCF and deep-based frameworks in terms of tracking accuracy and tracking success rate.

Title: Online learning-empowered smart management for A<sup>2</sup>O process in sewage treatment processes.
Year: 2022
Authors: Fan Yuqi, Guo Zhiwei, Wang Jianhui, Zhang Bing, Shen Yu, Gao Xu
Abstract: Using artificial intelligence method to describe general working process is a more meaningful and widely used idea in various practical projects. At the same time, it is also an important way to realize intelligent management. Water pollution is serious all over the world, also the intelligent management of sewage treatment has always been one of the urgent problems to be solved. For this, an intelligent management system is designed in this study to realize automatic monitoring and intelligent decision-making of sewage treatment. However, the existing technology usually trains artificial intelligence models based on historical data, and such models have some limitations in describing nonlinear and complex wastewater treatment processes. Offline machine learning lacks dynamic adaptive characteristics to scene changes. Considering this, this paper designs an online learning-empowered smart management for A<sup>2</sup>/O process in sewage treatment processes (OL-AP). Online learning is based on the new data generated by the scene transformation, so that the model can learn again and give better results. In this study, relevant simulation experiments are carried out on the sewage treatment data of a sewage treatment plant in Chongqing. Firstly, automatic data collection is realized based on the sensor network of the IoT. Then, according to the preprocessed data, the designed prediction model is trained and a set of parameters with better evaluation indexes is obtained. Finally, online learning uses the latest data samples based on the online feedback of real scenes to optimize the model by retraining and adjusting parameters.

Title: The nature of creativity: The roles of genetic factors, personality traits, cognitive abilities, and environmental sources.
Year: 2016
Authors: Kandler Christian, Riemann Rainer, Angleitner Alois, Spinath Frank M, Borkenau Peter, Penke Lars
Abstract: This multitrait multimethod twin study examined the structure and sources of individual differences in creativity. According to different theoretical and metrological perspectives, as well as suggestions based on previous research, we expected 2 aspects of individual differences, which can be described as perceived creativity and creative test performance. We hypothesized that perceived creativity, reflecting typical creative thinking and behavior, should be linked to specific personality traits, whereas test creativity, reflecting maximum task-related creative performance, should show specific associations with cognitive abilities. Moreover, we tested whether genetic variance in intelligence and personality traits account for the genetic component of creativity. Multiple-rater and multimethod data (self- and peer reports, observer ratings, and test scores) from 2 German twin studies-the Bielefeld Longitudinal Study of Adult Twins and the German Observational Study of Adult Twins-were analyzed. Confirmatory factor analyses yielded the expected 2 correlated aspects of creativity. Perceived creativity showed links to openness to experience and extraversion, whereas tested figural creativity was associated with intelligence and also with openness. Multivariate behavioral genetic analyses indicated that the heritability of tested figural creativity could be accounted for by the genetic component of intelligence and openness, whereas a substantial genetic component in perceived creativity could not be explained. A primary source of individual differences in creativity was due to environmental influences, even after controlling for random error and method variance. The findings are discussed in terms of the multifaceted nature and construct validity of creativity as an individual characteristic. (PsycINFO Database Record

Title: Intelligence moderates reinforcement learning: a mini-review of the neural evidence.

Authors: Chen Chong
Abstract: Our understanding of the neural basis of reinforcement learning and intelligence, two key factors contributing to human strivings, has progressed significantly recently. However, the overlap of these two lines of research, namely, how intelligence affects neural responses during reinforcement learning, remains uninvestigated. A mini-review of three existing studies suggests that higher IQ (especially fluid IQ) may enhance the neural signal of positive prediction error in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum, several brain substrates of reinforcement learning or intelligence.

Title: Metaphorically speaking: cognitive abilities and the production of figurative language.
Year: 2013
Authors: Beaty Roger E, Silvia Paul J
Abstract: Figurative language is one of the most common expressions of creative behavior in everyday life. However, the cognitive mechanisms behind figures of speech such as metaphors remain largely unexplained. Recent evidence suggests that fluid and executive abilities are important to the generation of conventional and creative metaphors. The present study investigated whether several factors of the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model of intelligence contribute to generating these different types of metaphors. Specifically, the roles of fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), and broad retrieval ability (Gr) were explored. Participants completed a series of intelligence tests and were asked to produce conventional and creative metaphors. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the contribution of the different factors of intelligence to metaphor production. For creative metaphor, there were large effects of Gf (β = .45) and Gr (β = .52); for conventional metaphor, there was a moderate effect of Gc (β = .30). Creative and conventional metaphors thus appear to be anchored in different patterns of abilities: Creative metaphors rely more on executive processes, whereas conventional metaphors primarily draw from acquired vocabulary knowledge.

Title: Design of Table Tennis Training Competition Knowledge Interaction Platform Integrating Improved Swarm Intelligence Algorithm.
Year: 2022
Authors: Li Deqi
Abstract: Table tennis is China 's national game and the proudest sport in China's sports field. During the research and technology service work of the Chinese table tennis team for many years, it has accumulated a large amount of valuable data on the analysis of skills and tactics of training and matches, match video, training monitoring, and so on. This paper discusses the relevant theory of swarm intelligence algorithm processing big data on the table tennis training competition knowledge interaction platform system, as well as the technical support of Nginx and Tomcat, and determines the technical basis of the table tennis training competition knowledge interaction platform. Through the establishment of the firefly algorithm model, the resource search ability is enhanced, and the traditional firefly algorithm is improved. From the results of the system performance test, it can be found that the improved swarm intelligence algorithm adopted in this paper improves the global convergence, and the load balancing degree gradually decreases with the increase of time. The improved firefly algorithm shows good performance when the bandwidth is low, and the resource occupancy rate is greatly reduced. When the bandwidth is 20, it is reduced by 12.55%. It solves the shortcomings of long time and low success rate, so as to verify the convenience of the system operation and the power of functions and make the platform more intelligent and efficient.

Title: A Hybrid State/Disturbance Observer-Based Feedback Control of Robot with Multiple Constraints.
Year: 2022
Authors: Xu Du, Hu Tete, Ma Ying, Shu Xin
Abstract: Controlling the manipulator is a big challenge due to its hysteresis, deadzone, saturation, and the disturbances of actuators. This study proposes a hybrid state/disturbance observer-based multiple-constraint control mechanism to address this difficulty. It first proposes a hybrid state/disturbance observer to simultaneously estimate the unmeasurable states and external disturbances. Based on this, a barrier Lyapunov function is proposed and implemented to handle output saturation constraints, and a back-stepping control method is developed to provide sufficient control performance under multiple constraints. Furthermore, the stability of the proposed controller is analyzed and proved. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out on a 2-DOF and 6-DOF robot, respectively. The results show that the proposed control method can effectively achieve the desired control performance. Compared with several commonly used control methods and intelligent control methods, the proposed method shows superiority. Experiments on a 6-DOF robot verify that the proposed method has good tracking performance for all joints and does not violate constraints.

Year: 2022
Authors: Loseto Giuseppe, Scioscia Floriano, Ruta Michele, Gramegna Filippo, Ieva Saverio, Fasciano Corrado, Bilenchi Ivano, Loconte Davide
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cyber-Physical Systems allows machine learning inference on acquired data with ever greater accuracy, thanks to models trained with massive amounts of information generated by Internet of Things devices. Edge Intelligence is increasingly adopted to execute inference on data at the border of local networks, exploiting models trained in the Cloud. However, the training tasks on Edge nodes are not supported yet with flexible dynamic migration between Edge and Cloud. This paper proposes a Cloud-Edge AI microservice architecture, based on Osmotic Computing principles. Notable features include: (i) containerized architecture enabling training and inference on the Edge, Cloud, or both, exploiting computational resources opportunistically to reach the best prediction accuracy; and (ii) microservice encapsulation of each architectural module, allowing a direct mapping with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Grounding on the proposed architecture: (i) a prototype has been realized with commodity hardware leveraging open-source software technologies; and (ii) it has been then used in a small-scale intelligent manufacturing case study, carrying out experiments. The obtained results validate the feasibility and key benefits of the approach.

Title: Foraging Cognition: Reviving the Ecological Intelligence Hypothesis.
Year: 2017
Authors: Rosati Alexandra G
Abstract: What are the origins of intelligent behavior? The demands associated with living in complex social groups have been the favored explanation for the evolution of primate cognition in general and human cognition in particular. However, recent comparative research indicates that ecological variation can also shape cognitive abilities. I synthesize the emerging evidence that 'foraging cognition' - skills used to exploit food resources, including spatial memory, decision-making, and inhibitory control - varies adaptively across primates. These findings provide a new framework for the evolution of human cognition, given our species' dependence on costly, high-value food resources. Understanding the origins of the human mind will require an integrative theory accounting for how humans are unique in both our sociality and our ecology.

Title: Application of RoboCup 3D and Intelligent Technology in Football Simulation League.
Year: 2022
Authors: Wei Shenghui, Qin Huibing
Abstract: Intelligent technology has been recently more developed which is due to the advancement in the technology sector. Moreover, every industry is now moving toward adoption of the intelligent technology to provide better services along with informed decisions which are possible only if devices have built-in intelligence. Likewise, in football simulation league, assigning suitable roles to each robot according to the real-time characteristics of complex and changeable field conditions is the key to win the game. In order to solve the problems of low research efficiency and poor simulation effect, this paper aims to deeply explore the application of RoboCup 3D and intelligent technology in football simulation league. Firstly, the movement speed, shooting speed, and direction of the players are measured. Secondly, a highly intelligent goal keeping and defense method and triangle attack strategy are proposed. The defense strategy is mainly that when the other team is in the state of attack, we send players to intercept the other player with the ball, and the triangle attack strategy is to use the three players in the appropriate position to cooperate with each other. The triangular attack team is composed of core attacking players and two auxiliary attacking players. This method is applied to football simulation league. RoboCup 3D simulation experiments show that the proposed method has good simulation effects in terms of ball loss rate and winning streak, which shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the research efficiency and simulation effect and has certain practicability.

Authors: Dimitrov Yasen, Vazova Tanja
Abstract: The article presents the results of the preliminary survey and pilot application of the methodological toolkit for the improvement of certain competencies, which are part of the soft skills of professionals in the long-term care sector in Bulgaria. Based on the survey the authors define 2 target competencies, namely conflict management and empathic interaction. These skills are considered a part of the scope of emotional intelligence and its constituent dimensions and authors use Daniel Goleman's ability-based model as a base for their conceptual frame and theoretical explanations. In order to present their thesis, the authors perform a soft skill analysis of the long-term care sector; define the construct emotional intelligence and justify their choice of a theoretical model for the subsequent survey. On this basis, they develop a training design for the development of these skills and present the results achieved through its pilot application. The study includes 62 participants randomly divided into a test and control groups. The level of targeted skills is measured (before and after) and the authors report a significant increase in those skills (empathic interaction, net effect 1.87; conflict management, net effect 1.75). In conclusion, the authors open a discussion on the importance of emotional management as an essential part of any profession related to health care and underline its importance for the quality of caregiving services.

Title: Human trust in otherware - a systematic literature review bringing all antecedents together.
Year: 2023
Authors: Saßmannshausen Till, Burggräf Peter, Hassenzahl Marc, Wagner Johannes
Abstract: Technological systems are becoming increasingly smarter, which causes a shift in the way they are seen: from tools used to execute specific tasks to social counterparts with whom to cooperate. To ensure that these interactions are successful, trust has proven to be the most important driver. We conducted an extensive and structured review with the goal to reveal all previously researched antecedents influencing the human trust in technology-based counterparts. In doing so, we synthesised 179 papers and uncovered 479 trust antecedents. We assigned these antecedents to four main groups. Three of them have been explored before: environment, trustee, and trustor. Within this paper, we argue for a fourth group, the interaction. This quadripartition allows the inclusion of antecedents that were not considered previously. Moreover, we critically question the practice of uncovering more and more trust antecedents, which already led to an opaque plethora and thus becomes increasingly complex for practitioners.<b>Practitioner summary:</b> Future designers of intelligent and interactive technology will have to consider trust to a greater extent. We emphasise that there are far more trust antecedents - and interdependencies - to consider than the ethically motivated discussions about "Trustworthy AI" suggest. For this purpose, we derived a trust map as a sound basis.

Title: Midinfrared Spectroscopic Analysis of Aqueous Mixtures Using Artificial-Intelligence-Enhanced Metamaterial Waveguide Sensing Platform.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhou Jingkai, Zhang Zixuan, Dong Bowei, Ren Zhihao, Liu Weixin, Lee Chengkuo
Abstract: As miniaturized solutions, mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide sensors are promising for label-free compositional detection of mixtures leveraging plentiful absorption fingerprints. However, the quantitative analysis of liquid mixtures is still challenging using MIR waveguide sensors, as the absorption spectrum overlaps for multiple organic components accompanied by strong water absorption background. Here, we present an artificial-intelligence-enhanced metamaterial waveguide sensing platform (AIMWSP) for aqueous mixture analysis in the MIR. With the sensitivity-improved metamaterial waveguide and assistance of machine learning, the MIR absorption spectra of a ternary mixture in water can be successfully distinguished and decomposed to single-component spectra for predicting concentration. A classification accuracy of 98.88% for 64 mixing ratios and 92.86% for four concentrations below the limit of detection (972 ppm, based on 3σ) with steps of 300 ppm are realized. Besides, the mixture concentration prediction with root-mean-squared error varying from 0.107 vol % to 1.436 vol % is also achieved. Our work indicates the potential of further extending this sensing platform to MIR spectrometer-on-chip aiming for the data analytics of multiple organic components in aqueous environments.

Abstract: Intelligence is associated with a network of distributed gray matter areas including the frontal and parietal higher association cortices and primary processing areas of the temporal and occipital lobes. Efficient information transfer between gray matter regions implicated in intelligence is thought to be critical for this trait to emerge. Genetic factors implicated in intelligence and gray matter may promote a high capacity for information transfer. Whether these genetic factors act globally or on local gray matter areas separately is not known. Brain maps of phenotypic and genetic associations between gray matter volume and intelligence were made using structural equation modeling of 3T MRI T1-weighted scans acquired in 167 adult twins of the newly acquired U-TWIN cohort. Subsequently, structural connectivity analyses (DTI) were performed to test the hypothesis that gray matter regions associated with intellectual ability form a densely connected core. Gray matter regions associated with intellectual ability were situated in the right prefrontal, bilateral temporal, bilateral parietal, right occipital and subcortical regions. Regions implicated in intelligence had high structural connectivity density compared to 10,000 reference networks (p=0.031). The genetic association with intelligence was for 39% explained by a genetic source unique to these regions (independent of total brain volume), this source specifically implicated the right supramarginal gyrus. Using a twin design, we show that intelligence is genetically represented in a spatially distributed and densely connected network of gray matter regions providing a high capacity infrastructure. Although genes for intelligence have overlap with those for total brain volume, we present evidence that there are genes for intelligence that act specifically on the subset of brain areas that form an efficient brain network.

Title: Minimal Relationship between Local Gyrification and General Cognitive Ability in Humans.

Abstract: Previous studies suggest that gyrification is associated with superior cognitive abilities in humans, but the strength of this relationship remains unclear. Here, in two samples of related individuals (total N = 2882), we calculated an index of local gyrification (LGI) at thousands of cortical surface points using structural brain images and an index of general cognitive ability (g) using performance on cognitive tests. Replicating previous studies, we found that phenotypic and genetic LGI-g correlations were positive and statistically significant in many cortical regions. However, all LGI-g correlations in both samples were extremely weak, regardless of whether they were significant or nonsignificant. For example, the median phenotypic LGI-g correlation was 0.05 in one sample and 0.10 in the other. These correlations were even weaker after adjusting for confounding neuroanatomical variables (intracranial volume and local cortical surface area). Furthermore, when all LGIs were considered together, at least 89% of the phenotypic variance of g remained unaccounted for. We conclude that the association between LGI and g is too weak to have profound implications for our understanding of the neurobiology of intelligence. This study highlights potential issues when focusing heavily on statistical significance rather than effect sizes in large-scale observational neuroimaging studies.

Title: Parallel Radars: From Digital Twins to Digital Intelligence for Smart Radar Systems.
Year: 2022
Authors: Liu Yuhang, Shen Yu, Fan Lili, Tian Yonglin, Ai Yunfeng, Tian Bin, Liu Zhongmin, Wang Fei-Yue
Abstract: Radar is widely employed in many applications, especially in autonomous driving. At present, radars are only designed as simple data collectors, and they are unable to meet new requirements for real-time and intelligent information processing as environmental complexity increases. It is inevitable that smart radar systems will need to be developed to deal with these challenges and digital twins in cyber-physical systems (CPS) have proven to be effective tools in many aspects. However, human involvement is closely related to radar technology and plays an important role in the operation and management of radars; thus, digital twins' radars in CPS are insufficient to realize smart radar systems due to the inadequate consideration of human factors. ACP-based parallel intelligence in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is used to construct a novel framework for smart radars, called Parallel Radars. A Parallel Radar consists of three main parts: a Descriptive Radar for constructing artificial radar systems in cyberspace, a Predictive Radar for conducting computational experiments with artificial systems, and a Prescriptive Radar for providing prescriptive control to both physical and artificial radars to complete parallel execution. To connect silos of data and protect data privacy, federated radars are proposed. Additionally, taking mines as an example, the application of Parallel Radars in autonomous driving is discussed in detail, and various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Parallel Radars.

Title: The culturally intelligent way of acculturating: Examining cultural intelligence and acculturation orientations among foreign workers in the Danish context of reception.
Year: 2021
Authors: Ozer Simon, Schwartz Seth J
Abstract: In contemporary globalized societies, the number of foreign workers is increasing, resulting in greater intercultural contact and adaptation. Foreign workers apply their cultural intelligence when adapting to and working in multicultural environments, resulting in affiliations with both their cultural heritage and their destination cultural stream. We examined foreign workers' (N = 264) intercultural adaptation in the globalized context of Denmark. We found that cultural intelligence was directly and positively linked with adaptable work performance. Furthermore, cultural intelligence was indirectly and negatively associated with sociocultural adaptation difficulties through endorsement of Danish culture. Likewise, perceived negative context of reception was indirectly and positively associated with sociocultural adaptation difficulties through low endorsement of Danish culture. Additionally, perceived stress predicted adaptable work performance, whereas perceived context of reception and sociocultural adaptation difficulties did not. Overall, our results suggest involvement in the destination culture as a culturally intelligent way of applying one's cultural capabilities, suggesting that the perceived context of reception is of great importance for helping foreign workers adapt to their destination cultural environments.

Title: An integrated perspective on insight.
Year: 2016
Authors: Martinsen Øyvind L, Furnham Adrian, Hærem Thorvald
Abstract: The present study on insight is based on an integration of Kaplan and Simon's (1990) information processing theory of insight, a cognitive style theory, and achievement motivation theory. The style theory is the Assimilator (rule oriented, familiarity seeking)-Explorer (novelty seeking, explorative) styles (Kaufmann, 1979). Our hypothesis is that the effectiveness of 2 types of search constraints (prior experience and solution hints) for solving insight problems is moderated by both cognitive style and achievement needs, and depending on optimal levels of achievement motivation for different task conditions. We tested the hypothesis in a randomized experiment in which 3 levels of achievement needs and 1 type of search constraint (solution hints were available or not available) were experimentally manipulated. In addition, participants completed a cognitive style test, a measure of prior problem-solving experience (the second type of search constraint), and controls for intelligence. There were 476 participants (the mean age was 18.4 years). Results revealed 2 similar and significant 3-way interactions between styles, achievement needs, and the 2 types of search constraints. The pattern of interaction supported the idea that stylistic competence for the task characteristics (with and without search constraints available), when combined with manipulated achievement needs, predicted performance in counterintuitive ways but in line with the classic achievement motivation theory. With appropriate stylistic competence for the task characteristics elevated achievement needs led to poorer performance. With less appropriate stylistic competence, performance improved with increasing motivation. Implications for information processing theory are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record

Title: Personality descriptions influence perceived cuteness of children and nurturing motivation toward them.
Year: 2023
Authors: Takamatsu Reina, Kusumi Takashi, Nittono Hiroshi
Abstract: The current empirical evidence regarding the effects of personality on physical attractiveness is limited to adult faces. In two preregistered studies, we demonstrated that personality descriptions influenced perceived cuteness, warmth, competence of young children, and female adults' nurturing motivation toward them. Study 1 showed that participants rated children accompanied by positive personality descriptions as cuter, friendlier, and more intelligent than their initial ratings. Negative personality descriptions reduced perceived cuteness in children, which in turn reduced nurturing motivation. Study 2 showed that negative personality descriptions consistently reduced perceived cuteness and warmth ratings after manipulation, regardless of the initial level of perceived cuteness. After one week, cuteness and warmth ratings in the positive personality condition tended to return to their initial ratings. However, the effect of negative personality descriptions on cuteness ratings persisted for all children. Together, our findings suggest that female adults' perception of cuteness and nurturing motivation are induced not only by children's appearance but also their personality.

Title: Intelligent Safety Ergonomics: A Cleaner Research Direction for Ergonomics in the Era of Big Data.
Year: 2022
Authors: Dong Longjun, Wang Jiachuang
Abstract: Safety ergonomics is an important branch of safety science and environmental engineering. As humans enter the era of big data, the development of information technology has brought new opportunities and challenges to the innovation, transformation, and upgrading of safety ergonomics, as the traditional safety ergonomics theory has gradually failed to adapt to the need for safe and clean production. Intelligent safety ergonomics (ISE) is regarded as a new direction for the development of safety ergonomics in the era of big data. Unfortunately, since ISE is an emerging concept, there is no research to clarify its basic problems, which leads to a lack of theoretical guidance for the research and practice of ISE. In order to solve the shortcomings of traditional safety ergonomics theories and methods, first of all, this paper answers the basic questions of ISE, including the basic concepts, characteristics, attributes, contents, and research objects. Then, practical application functions of ISE are systematically clarified. Finally, following the life cycle of the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the system, it ends with a discussion of the challenges and application prospects of ISE. The conclusion shows that ISE is a cleaner research direction for ergonomics in the era of big data, that it can deepen the understanding of humans, machines, and environment systems, and it can provide a new method for further research on safety and cleaner production. Overall, this paper not only helps safety researchers and practitioners to correctly understand the concept of intelligent safety ergonomics, but it will certainly inject energy and vitality into the development of safety ergonomics and cleaner production.

Title: Factor structure of intelligence and divergent thinking subtests: A registered report.
Year: 2021
Authors: Warne Russell T, Golightly Sam, Black Makai
Abstract: Psychologists have investigated creativity for 70 years, and it is now seen as being an important construct, both scientifically and because of its practical value to society. However, several fundamental unresolved problems persist, including a suitable definition of creativity and the ability of psychometric tests to measure divergent thinking-an important component of creativity-in a way that aligns with theory. It is this latter point that this registered report is designed to address. We propose to administer two divergent thinking tests (the verbal and figural versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking; TTCT) with an intelligence test (the International Cognitive Ability Resource test; ICAR). We will then subject the subscores from these tests to confirmatory factor analysis to test which of nine theoretically plausible models best fits the data. When this study is completed, we hope to better understand whether the degree to which the TTCT and ICAR measure distinct constructs. This study will be conducted in accordance with all open science practices, including pre-registration, open data and syntax, and open materials (with the exception of copyrighted and confidential test stimuli).

Title: Framework for Vehicle Make and Model Recognition-A New Large-Scale Dataset and an Efficient Two-Branch-Two-Stage Deep Learning Architecture.
Year: 2022
Authors: Lyu Yangxintong, Schiopu Ionut, Cornelis Bruno, Munteanu Adrian
Abstract: In recent years, Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) has attracted a lot of attention as it plays a crucial role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Accurate and efficient VMMR systems are required in real-world applications including intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. The paper introduces a new large-scale dataset and a novel deep learning paradigm for VMMR. A new large-scale dataset dubbed Diverse large-scale VMM (DVMM) is proposed collecting image-samples with the most popular vehicle brands operating in Europe. A novel VMMR framework is proposed which follows a two-branch architecture performing make and model recognition respectively. A two-stage training procedure and a novel decision module are proposed to process the make and model predictions and compute the final model prediction. In addition, a novel metric based on the true positive rate is proposed to compare classification confusion of the proposed 2B-2S and the baseline methods. A complex experimental validation is carried out, demonstrating the generality, diversity, and practicality of the proposed DVMM dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed framework provides 93.95% accuracy over the more diverse DVMM dataset and 95.85% accuracy over traditional VMMR datasets. The proposed two-branch approach outperforms the conventional one-branch approach for VMMR over small-, medium-, and large-scale datasets by providing lower vehicle model confusion and reduced inter-make ambiguity. The paper demonstrates the advantages of the proposed two-branch VMMR paradigm in terms of robustness and lower confusion relative to single-branch designs.

Title: An Intelligent Classification Method of Multisource Enterprise Financial Data Based on SAS Model.
Year: 2022
Authors: Xu Xiuyan
Abstract: An enterprise is often faced with a large amount of financial information and data information. It is inefficient to rely solely on manual work, and the accuracy is difficult to guarantee. For the multisource data of corporate finance, it is more difficult for financial personnel to accurately analyze the connections between the data. For the multisource financial data of enterprise, this is also a time-consuming and laborious task for financial personnel. At the same time, it is difficult to find the correlation between multiple sources of data and then formulate financial data that guides the development of the enterprise. With the advancement of intelligent algorithms, an intelligent classification algorithm similar to the SAS model has emerged, which can realize the intelligent classification of enterprise financial multisource data and accurately predict the future development trend, which is extremely beneficial to the development and performance of the enterprise. This article mainly combines the financial intelligence classification model SAS with clustering and decision tree methods to classify the financial multisource information and uses the neural network method to carry out the future development trend of corporate finance. The research results show that the maximum error of enterprise financial classification after using the intelligent classification method is only 3.71% and that the forecast error of the future development trend of enterprise finance is only 1.77%. This is an acceptable error range, and this intelligent classification method is also greatly improving the efficiency of corporate financial management.

Title: Perception-to-Cognition Tactile Sensing Based on Artificial-Intelligence-Motivated Human Full-Skin Bionic Electronic Skin.
Year: 2022
Authors: Niu Hongsen, Li Hao, Gao Song, Li Yang, Wei Xiao, Chen Yuke, Yue Wenjing, Zhou Weijia, Shen Guozhen
Abstract: Traditional electronic skin (e-skin), due to the lack of human-brain-like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)-motivated full-skin bionic (FSB) e-skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis-dermis-hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e-skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa<sup>-1</sup> (<1 kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa<sup>-1</sup> (1-34 kPa), and fast response/recovery time of <5.6 ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a "brain". First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis-dermis-hypodermis and a five-layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e-skin with a six-layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real-time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

Title: New Progress in Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Research Based on Big Data Processing of IOT Systems on Intelligent Production Lines.
Year: 2022
Authors: Shi He, Cao Guohua, Ma Guoqing, Duan Jingsong, Bai Jimeng, Meng Xiangyin
Abstract: Intelligent production line is the abbreviation of intelligent production line. Intelligent production line refers to a form of production organization that uses intelligent manufacturing technology to realize the production process of products. The actual manufacturing process includes different levels and links, and each step cooperates to create a high-efficiency production line. The intelligent production line includes 3 levels covering automation equipment, digital workshops, and intelligent factories and runs through 6 major links of intelligent manufacturing (intelligent management, intelligent monitoring, intelligent processing, intelligent assembly, intelligent inspection, and intelligent logistics). The emergence of the Internet of Things system has changed the way of information dissemination. The system combines radio frequency automatic identification and global positioning system technologies to achieve functions such as information exchange and processing, enabling information processing to be intelligent and improving resource utilization. Big data processing includes multiple data processing procedures, but data quality is the most important link in the entire process, and each data processing link will have an impact on the quality of big data. The big data processing process mainly includes data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data processing and analysis, data display, data visualization, data application, and other links. This article aims to study the new progress of artificial intelligence algorithms for big data processing of IOT systems on intelligent production lines. It is hoped that through the development of intelligent production lines and big data processing technologies, ways to optimize artificial intelligence algorithms can be found. This study proposes a metadata replication method based on a separate replication strategy, which separates the replication process of the data operation log, each is independent, and shortens the data replication time. Combining the existing intelligent production line network platform in the laboratory and carrying out the research of the intelligent production line network state prediction system based on the neural network to design a network prediction system can prejudge the operation status of the intelligent production line network. The experimental results in this article show that when the Namenode mode is used to read data and when the number of clients reaches 8, the data processing basically remains unchanged. When the NCluster system reads data and when the number of clients is 6, the data is processed 1256. When the number of clients is 20, the data is processed 2100, the NCluster system will remain stable when the number of clients reaches 12, and compared with the Namenode system, it has obvious advantages.

Authors: Zhang Yufei, Sun Bohua, Li Yaxin, Zhao Shuai, Zhu Xianglei, Ma Wenxiao, Ma Fangwu, Wu Liang
Abstract: The testing and evaluation system has been the key technology and security with its necessity in the development and deployment of maturing automated vehicles. In this research, the physics-intelligence hybrid theory-based dynamic scenario library generation method is proposed to improve system performance, in particular, the testing efficiency and accuracy for automated vehicles. A general framework of the dynamic scenario library generation is established. Then, the parameterized scenario based on the dimension optimization method is specified to obtain the effective scenario element set. Long-tail functions for performance testing of specific ODD are constructed as optimization boundaries and critical scenario searching methods are proposed based on the node optimization and sample expansion methods for the low-dimensional scenario library generation and the reinforcement learning for the high-dimensional one, respectively. The scenario library generation method is evaluated with the naturalistic driving data (NDD) of the intelligent electric vehicle in the field test. Results show better efficient and accuracy performances compared with the ideal testing library and the NDD, respectively, in both low- and high-dimensional scenarios.

Title: Intelligent Reading of English Text Based on the Generative Model Constraint Label Fusion.
Year: 2022
Authors: Yang Hua, Wei Huiliang
Abstract: The intelligent reading of English text is affected by complex environmental factors, which will result in low reading accuracy and poor reader experience. Based on the artificial intelligence model, this study constructs the artificial intelligence English text reading model by using the generative model constraint label, which helps to improve the intelligence of the English text reading effect. This study also designs a multigraph label fusion algorithm based on generative model constraints. By making full use of the prior knowledge of multiple graphs, the result of fusion graph segmentation is achieved. Moreover, this study also uses the combination of two algorithms, namely, the combination of GMM and MRF, to express the spatial correlation of local statistical features and image pixels in a comprehensive and all-round way. Another model design also includes a series of joint distributions of the learning data for the construction of the image energy function, and the conditional probability distribution is used as the model for prediction. At the end of the study, another variable control experiment is carried out to analyze the performance of the model and the accuracy of the model in English text recognition and classification is studied and counted. The research results show that the intelligent reading model constructed based on this study can meet the needs of the actual situation.

Title: Is general intelligence little more than the speed of higher-order processing?
Year: 2017
Authors: Schubert Anna-Lena, Hagemann Dirk, Frischkorn Gidon T
Abstract: Individual differences in the speed of information processing have been hypothesized to give rise to individual differences in general intelligence. Consistent with this hypothesis, reaction times (RTs) and latencies of event-related potential have been shown to be moderately associated with intelligence. These associations have been explained either in terms of individual differences in some brain-wide property such as myelination, the speed of neural oscillations, or white-matter tract integrity, or in terms of individual differences in specific processes such as the signal-to-noise ratio in evidence accumulation, executive control, or the cholinergic system. Here we show in a sample of 122 participants, who completed a battery of RT tasks at 2 laboratory sessions while an EEG was recorded, that more intelligent individuals have a higher speed of higher-order information processing that explains about 80% of the variance in general intelligence. Our results do not support the notion that individuals with higher levels of general intelligence show advantages in some brain-wide property. Instead, they suggest that more intelligent individuals benefit from a more efficient transmission of information from frontal attention and working memory processes to temporal-parietal processes of memory storage.

Title: Dynamic measurements of speed and risk perception during driving: Evidence of speed misestimation from continuous ratings and video analysis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ju Uijong, Wallraven Christian
Abstract: Investigating the factors underlying perceived speed and risk is crucial to ensure safe driving. However, existing studies on this topic usually measure speed and risk perception indirectly after a driving session, which makes it difficult to trace dynamic effects and time points of potential misestimates. To address this problem, we developed and validated a novel continuous method for dynamically measuring risk and speed perceptions. To study the factors affecting risk and speed perception, we presented participants with videos captured on the same racing track from the same point of view but with different drivers who varied in their speed and risk profiles. During the experiment, participants used a joystick to continuously rate the subjectively perceived risk of driving in the first block and the perceived speed in the second block. Our analysis of these dynamic ratings indicates that risk and speed estimates were decoupled, with curves resulting in decreased speeds but increased risk ratings. However, a close distance to the car in front increased both speed and risk. Based on actual and estimated speed data, we found that overtaking cars on curves resulted in participants overestimating their own speed, whereas an increase in the distance to the car in front on a straight course led to underestimations of their own speed. Our results showcase the usefulness of dynamic rating profiles for in-depth investigations into situations that could result in drivers misjudging speed or risk and will thus help the development of more intelligent, human-centered driving assistance systems.

Title: Research on System Construction and Strategy of Intelligent Sports in the Implementation of National Fitness.
Year: 2022
Authors: Tang Yuxin, Zan Shengfeng, Zhang Xiaowen
Abstract: This paper studies the construction and development strategy of intelligent sports system in the context of Chinese National Fitness Program with methods of literature review and model construction. The research shows that there are four dilemmas in the implementation of intelligent sports in national fitness: data security, market monopoly, legal supervision, and product iteration. However, there are also three promoting factors in this regard, including policy guarantee, market demand, and industrial upgrading. Following the principles of scientificity, effectiveness, public welfare, and collaboration, this paper designs a system for intelligent sports in national fitness. The construction of the national fitness intelligent sports system mainly consists of four modules, including basic framework construction, function design, content design, and operation analysis. With the systematic analysis of the status quo of intelligent sports application in national fitness, this paper puts forward intelligent sports development strategies in the implementation of national fitness from four aspects: optimizing the top-level design of government, speeding up industrial transformation and upgrading, constructing market supervision mechanism, and establishing a talent training system.

Title: Towards Automatic License Plate Detection.
Year: 2022
Authors: Mahmood Zahid, Khan Khurram, Khan Uzair, Adil Syed Hasan, Ali Syed Saad Azhar, Shahzad Mohsin
Abstract: Automatic License Plate Detection (ALPD) is an integral component of using computer vision approaches in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). An accurate detection of vehicles' license plates in images is a critical step that has a substantial impact on any ALPD system's recognition rate. In this paper, we develop an efficient license plate detecting technique through the intelligent combination of Faster R-CNN along with digital image processing techniques. The proposed algorithm initially detects vehicle(s) in the input image through Faster R-CNN. Later, the located vehicle is analyzed by a robust License Plate Localization Module (LPLM). The LPLM module primarily uses color segmentation and processes the HSV image to detect the license plate in the input image. Moreover, the LPLM module employs morphological filtering and dimension analysis to find the license plate. Detailed trials on challenging PKU datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms few recently developed methods by producing high license plates detection accuracy in much less execution time. The proposed work demonstrates a great feasibility for security and target detection applications.

Title: <i>Explananda</i> and <i>explanantia</i> in deep neural network models of neurological network functions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Moldoveanu Mihnea
Abstract: Depending on what we mean by "explanation," challenges to the explanatory depth and reach of deep neural network models of visual and other forms of intelligent behavior may need revisions to both the elementary building blocks of neural nets (the explananda) and to the ways in which experimental environments and training protocols are engineered (the explanantia). The two paths assume and imply sharply different conceptions of how an explanation explains and of the explanatory function of models.

Title: Extending Galactic Habitable Zone Modeling to Include the Emergence of Intelligent Life.
Year: 2015
Authors: Morrison Ian S, Gowanlock Michael G
Abstract: Previous studies of the galactic habitable zone have been concerned with identifying those regions of the Galaxy that may favor the emergence of complex life. A planet is deemed habitable if it meets a set of assumed criteria for supporting the emergence of such complex life. In this work, we extend the assessment of habitability to consider the potential for life to further evolve to the point of intelligence--termed the propensity for the emergence of intelligent life, φI. We assume φI is strongly influenced by the time durations available for evolutionary processes to proceed undisturbed by the sterilizing effects of nearby supernovae. The times between supernova events provide windows of opportunity for the evolution of intelligence. We developed a model that allows us to analyze these window times to generate a metric for φI, and we examine here the spatial and temporal variation of this metric. Even under the assumption that long time durations are required between sterilizations to allow for the emergence of intelligence, our model suggests that the inner Galaxy provides the greatest number of opportunities for intelligence to arise. This is due to the substantially higher number density of habitable planets in this region, which outweighs the effects of a higher supernova rate in the region. Our model also shows that φI is increasing with time. Intelligent life emerged at approximately the present time at Earth's galactocentric radius, but a similar level of evolutionary opportunity was available in the inner Galaxy more than 2 Gyr ago. Our findings suggest that the inner Galaxy should logically be a prime target region for searches for extraterrestrial intelligence and that any civilizations that may have emerged there are potentially much older than our own.

Year: 2021
Authors: Zhang Yanhong, Zhang Lifen, Liu Wei
Abstract: In order to study the observation of postoperative vital sign data of critically ill patients, this paper developed a set of vital sign data acquisition system based on intelligence and realized the design of vital sign data acquisition system APP based on Android Studio programming software, which was used to realize the information collection of vital sign data of patients. PDA is connected with a vital sign measuring equipment through Bluetooth. The patient's wristband is scanned with PDA to read the patient's information, and then the measured vital sign data are obtained automatically by measuring APP. The initial alarm value is set to be greater than 1%, and it needs more than 60 and less than or equal to 120 RR interval data to judge apnea. Information collection of intelligent vital sign detection can not only save the time of nursing staff but also improve the nursing quality.

Title: Hybrid Intelligence-Driven Medical Image Recognition for Remote Patient Diagnosis in Internet of Medical Things.
Year: 2022
Authors: Guo Zhiwei, Shen Yu, Wan Shaohua, Shang Wen-Long, Yu Keping
Abstract: In ear of smart cities, intelligent medical image recognition technique has become a promising way to solve remote patient diagnosis in IoMT. Although deep learning-based recognition approaches have received great development during the past decade, explainability always acts as a main obstacle to promote recognition approaches to higher levels. Because it is always hard to clearly grasp internal principles of deep learning models. In contrast, the conventional machine learning (CML)-based methods are well explainable, as they give relatively certain meanings to parameters. Motivated by the above view, this paper combines deep learning with the CML, and proposes a hybrid intelligence-driven medical image recognition framework in IoMT. On the one hand, the convolution neural network is utilized to extract deep and abstract features for initial images. On the other hand, the CML-based techniques are employed to reduce dimensions for extracted features and construct a strong classifier that output recognition results. A real dataset about pathologic myopia is selected to establish simulative scenario, in order to assess the proposed recognition framework. Results reveal that the proposal that improves recognition accuracy about two to three percent.

Title: Sentiment analysis of hotel online reviews using the BERT model and ERNIE model-Data from China.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wen Yu, Liang Yezhang, Zhu Xinhua
Abstract: The emotion analysis of hotel online reviews is discussed by using the neural network model BERT, which proves that this method can not only help hotel network platforms fully understand customer needs but also help customers find suitable hotels according to their needs and affordability and help hotel recommendations be more intelligent. Therefore, using the pretraining BERT model, a number of emotion analytical experiments were carried out through fine-tuning, and a model with high classification accuracy was obtained by frequently adjusting the parameters during the experiment. The BERT layer was taken as a word vector layer, and the input text sequence was used as the input to the BERT layer for vector transformation. The output vectors of BERT passed through the corresponding neural network and were then classified by the softmax activation function. ERNIE is an enhancement of the BERT layer. Both models can lead to good classification results, but the latter performs better. ERNIE exhibits stronger classification and stability than BERT, which provides a promising research direction for the field of tourism and hotels.

Title: Deep Learning Dual Neural Networks in the Construction of Learning Models for Online Courses in Piano Education.
Year: 2022
Authors: Lei Shijun, Liu Huiming
Abstract: The use of deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching children piano lessons promotes modern piano instruction and enhances the overall quality of education. To begin, a more thorough explanation of the teaching environment and the intelligent piano's features is provided. Then, a method for detecting the onset of a piano note using a Dual Neural Network (DNN) is proposed. By transforming the original time-domain waveform of the piano music signal into a frequency distribution that changes with time, the network can analyze the input signal's time-frequency. Finally, the intelligent piano teaching method combines deep learning with artificial intelligence (AI) to produce the best possible results for students learning the piano instrument. For children and their parents alike, it is a favorite, and it significantly impacts their interests. The proposed model has a 94% overall accuracy rate.

Title: Why do evening people consider themselves more intelligent than morning individuals? The role of big five, narcissism, and objective cognitive ability.
Year: 2019
Authors: Zajenkowski Marcin, Jankowski Konrad S, Stolarski Maciej
Abstract: Morningness-eveningness, or chronotype, reflects the timing of sleep-wake patterns across a 24-hour day. Extant research has revealed that chronotype correlates with numerous psychological constructs including cognitive ability. In the current research, we examined how people with different chronotypes perceive their intelligence. We expected eveningness to be positively associated with subjectively assessed intelligence (SAI) because evening chronotypes demonstrate slightly higher intelligence than morning individuals. Furthermore, we considered personality traits (Big Five and narcissism) and objective intelligence (measured with standardized tests of fluid and verbal IQ) as potential variables that could account for this relationship. Across two studies (<i>N</i> = 504 and 232), we found that eveningness was associated with higher SAI. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for objective intelligence. In Study 1, we also found that when conscientiousness and neuroticism were analyzed together with chronotype, the magnitude of positive association between eveningness and SAI increased. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that evening individuals exhibited higher narcissism, which fully accounted for their intelligence self-views. In the discussion, we speculate that daily struggles of evening chronotypes to function in morning-oriented society give them a basis to think positively about their intelligence to the extent of positive bias.

Title: Partisan ideological attitudes: Liberals are tolerant; the intelligent are intolerant.
Year: 2021
Authors: Ganzach Yoav, Schul Yaacov
Abstract: In this article we examine intolerance toward ideological outgroups, conceptualized as the negativity of the attitudes of liberals and conservatives toward their ideological outgroup. We show that conservatives are more ideologically intolerant than liberals and that the more intelligent are more ideologically intolerant than the less intelligent. We also show that the differences between liberals and conservatives and the differences between the more and less intelligent depend on ideological extremity: They are larger for extreme than for moderate ideologists. The implication of these results to questions regarding the relationship between intelligence and ideological intolerance and regarding the relationship between ideology and prejudice are discussed.

Title: A growth mindset about human minds promotes positive responses to intelligent technology.
Year: 2022
Authors: Dang Jianning, Liu Li
Abstract: Perceiving minds in technology agents, for example, robots designed with artificial intelligence (AI), is common and crucial in modern life. However, past studies have revealed that robots with a high level of minds elicit polarized responses. From a human-robot interaction perspective, we proposed that people' responses to robots, in part, originate from differences between fixed and growth mindsets about human minds-the beliefs regarding whether humans' mental capacities are fixed or incremental. We conducted five studies to test this assumption. A growth mindset about human minds was associated with or led to lower levels of negative feelings about robots (Study 1), more perceptions of robots as allies versus enemies (Study 2), more support for robotic research (Studies 3 and 4), and greater willingness to interact with robots (Study 5). Furthermore, the effect of a growth mindset about human minds on favorable responses to robots was more pronounced when robots were perceived as having high (versus low) levels of minds (Studies 3-5) and mediated by decreased concerns about robots (Study 5). By emphasizing the nuanced role of mindset beliefs about human minds in responses to intelligent technology, this research provides not only a new perspective on research into minds but also important implications for human-technology relationships.

Title: An Intelligent Optimization for Building Design Based on BP Neural Network and SPEA-II Multiobjective Algorithm.
Year: 2022
Authors: Xu Haiman
Abstract: With the continuous development of the field of building optimization, more and more optimization methods have sprung up, among which there are many kinds of intelligent optimization algorithms. This kind of intelligent optimization algorithm usually relies on the traditional building performance simulation method to obtain the building performance index for optimization. However, intelligent optimization algorithms generally require large-scale calculations. At the same time, the time required for building performance simulation is often limited by the complexity of building models and the configuration of computers, which leads to a long time for performance optimization, which cannot give efficient and accurate feedback to designers in engineering. Building performance optimization methods based on intelligent optimization algorithms are mainly used in scientific research and are difficult to put into practical projects. Therefore, this paper builds an accurate and efficient platform for building performance prediction and optimization to help designers make decisions combined with BP neural network and the SPEA-II multiobjective optimization algorithm. Besides, the optimization results of the case are quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and presented in visual form based on the BP neural network prediction model. Quantitative analysis includes the evolution process of solution set, convergence process, and comprehensive quality evaluation of solution set. Qualitative analysis includes Pareto frontier and optimal architectural scheme analysis. Finally, the conclusion shows that the platform prediction and optimization can give accurate and reliable optimal solution, and the optimal building scheme is reasonable and has high engineering application value.

Title: Low-Complexity Beamforming Design for a Cooperative Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Cell-Free Network.
Year: 2023
Authors: Siddiqi Muhammad Zain, Munir Aisha, Mohsan Syed Agha Hassnain, Shah Shashi, Chaudhary Sushank, Sangwongngam Paramin, Wuttisittikulkij Lunchakorn
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) networks are proposed to suppress the interference among collocated cells by deploying several BSs without cell boundaries. Nevertheless, as installing several base stations (BSs) may require high power consumption, cooperative CF networks integrated with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)/metasurface can avoid this problem. In such cooperative RIS-aided MIMO networks, efficient beamforming schemes are essential to boost their spectral and energy efficiency. However, most of the existing available beamforming schemes to maximize spectral and energy efficiency are complex and entail high complexity due to the matrix inversions. To this end, in this work we present a computationally efficient stochastic optimization-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to amplify the spectral efficiency of the cooperative RIS-aided CF MIMO system. In the proposed PSO algorithm, several swarms are generated, while the direction of each swarm is tuned in each iteration based on the sum-rate performance to obtain the best solution. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme can approximate the performance of the existing solutions for both the performance metrics, i.e., spectral and energy efficiency, at a very low complexity.

Title: Applying Enhanced Real-Time Monitoring and Counting Method for Effective Traffic Management in Tashkent.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kutlimuratov Alpamis, Khamzaev Jamshid, Kuchkorov Temur, Anwar Muhammad Shahid, Choi Ahyoung
Abstract: This study describes an applied and enhanced real-time vehicle-counting system that is an integral part of intelligent transportation systems. The primary objective of this study was to develop an accurate and reliable real-time system for vehicle counting to mitigate traffic congestion in a designated area. The proposed system can identify and track objects inside the region of interest and count detected vehicles. To enhance the accuracy of the system, we used the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model for vehicle identification owing to its high performance and short computing time. Vehicle tracking and the number of vehicles acquired used the DeepSort algorithm with the Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance as the main components of the algorithm and the proposed simulated loop technique, respectively. Empirical results were obtained using video images taken from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera on Tashkent roads and show that the counting system can produce 98.1% accuracy in 0.2408 s.

Title: The role of emotions in clinical reasoning and decision making.
Year: 2013
Authors: Marcum James A
Abstract: What role, if any, should emotions play in clinical reasoning and decision making? Traditionally, emotions have been excluded from clinical reasoning and decision making, but with recent advances in cognitive neuropsychology they are now considered an important component of them. Today, cognition is thought to be a set of complex processes relying on multiple types of intelligences. The role of mathematical logic (hypothetico-deductive thinking) or verbal linguistic intelligence in cognition, for example, is well documented and accepted; however, the role of emotional intelligence has received less attention-especially because its nature and function are not well understood. In this paper, I argue for the inclusion of emotions in clinical reasoning and decision making. To that end, developments in contemporary cognitive neuropsychology are initially examined and analyzed, followed by a review of the medical literature discussing the role of emotions in clinical practice. Next, a published clinical case is reconstructed and used to illustrate the recognition and regulation of emotions played during a series of clinical consultations, which resulted in a positive medical outcome. The paper's main thesis is that emotions, particularly in terms of emotional intelligence as a practical form of intelligence, afford clinical practitioners a robust cognitive resource for providing quality medical care.

Title: Intelligent User Interfaces and Their Evaluation: A Systematic Mapping Study.
Year: 2022
Authors: Brdnik Saša, Heričko Tjaša, Šumak Boštjan
Abstract: Intelligent user interfaces (IUI) are driven by the goal of improvement in human-computer interaction (HCI), mainly improving user interfaces' user experience (UX) or usability with the help of artificial intelligence. The main goal of this study is to find, assess, and synthesize existing state-of-the-art work in the field of IUI with an additional focus on the evaluation of IUI. This study analyzed 211 studies published in the field between 2012 and 2022. Studies are most frequently tied to HCI and SE domains. Definitions of IUI were observed, showing that adaptation, representation, and intelligence are key characteristics associated with IUIs, whereas adaptation, reasoning, and representation are the most commonly used verbs in their description. Evaluation of IUI is mainly conducted with experiments and questionnaires, though usability and UX are not considered together in evaluations. Most evaluations (81% of studies) reported partial or complete improvement in usability or UX. A shortage of evaluation tools, methods, and metrics, tailored for IUI, is noticed. Most often, empirical data collection methods and data sources in IUI evaluation studies are experiment, prototype development, and questionnaire.

Title: A moderate financial incentive can increase effort, but not intelligence test performance in adult volunteers.
Year: 2018
Authors: Gignac Gilles E
Abstract: A positive correlation between self-reported test-taking motivation and intelligence test performance has been reported. Additionally, some financial incentive experimental evidence suggests that intelligence test performance can be improved, based on the provision of financial incentives. However, only a small percentage of the experimental research has been conducted with adults. Furthermore, virtually none of the intelligence experimental research has measured the impact of financial incentives on test-taking motivation. Consequently, we conducted an experiment with 99 adult volunteers who completed a battery of intelligence tests under two conditions: no financial incentive and financial incentive (counterbalanced). We also measured self-reported test-taking importance and effort at time 1 and time 2. The financial incentive was observed to impact test-taking effort statistically significantly. By contrast, no statistically significant effects were observed for the intelligence test performance scores. Finally, the intelligence test scores were found to correlate positively with both test-taking importance (r<sub>c</sub>  = .28) and effort (r<sub>c</sub>  = .37), although only effort correlated uniquely with intelligence (partial r<sub>c</sub>  = .26). In conjunction with other empirical research, it is concluded that a financial incentive can increase test-taking effort. However, the potential effects on intelligence test performance in adult volunteers seem limited.

Title: Everyday Perceiver-Context Influences on Impression Formation: No Evidence of Consistent Effects.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xie Sally Y, Thai Sabrina, Hehman Eric
Abstract: Facial impressions (e.g., trustworthy, intelligent) vary considerably across different perceivers and targets. However, nearly all existing research comes from participants evaluating faces on a computer screen in a lab or office environment. We explored whether social perceptions could additionally be influenced by perceivers' experiential factors that vary in daily life: mood, environment, physiological state, and psychological situations. To that end, we tracked daily changes in participants' experienced contexts during impression formation using experience sampling. We found limited evidence that perceivers' contexts are an important factor in impressions. Perceiver context alone does not systematically influence trait impressions in a consistent manner-suggesting that perceiver and target idiosyncrasies are the most powerful drivers of social impressions. Overall, results suggest that perceivers' experienced contexts may play only a small role in impressions formed from faces.

Abstract: A comparative analysis of the psychological characteristics of the working and non-working population in the context of personal employment, demand and quality life. The study was conducted with the participation of 51 women and 58 men, age 65,35±5,25 years. Randomization into two groups: the 1st group - 59 people of those continuing to work in the field of higher and vocational education; the 2nd group (50 people) consisted of non-working pensioners whose labor activity was related to teaching, taking care of their families, children and grandchildren, the circle of their social contacts is limited by the connections necessary to ensure life. An assessment was made of the orientation of the personality, the level of prevailing needs, the formation and strength of motives, the degree of adequacy of one's own attitude to various life situations, and the psycho-emotional state. It is shown that working pensioners have a higher indicator of the personality's orientation to the task and a low indicator of the personality's orientation to oneself. In the 1st group a stable psycho-emotional state was revealed for a number of functional indicators of a physical, role, social nature, significantly higher indicators of vitality and the physical component of health, they strive to maintain professionalism, financial freedom, and independence. In the 2nd group the desire to overcome social isolation, the desire to develop creativity in oneself prevails. In the 1st and 2nd groups, there were no differences in the levels of the motivational-need sphere. To expand the possibilities of the life potential of an elderly person, it is necessary to study the psychological characteristics older working and non-working population.

Abstract: This work explores the complex field of HER2 testing in the HER2-low breast cancer era, with a focus on methodological aspects. We aim to propose clear positions to scientific societies, institutions, pathologists, and oncologists to guide and shape the appropriate diagnostic strategies for HER2-low breast cancer. The fundamental question at hand is whether the necessary tools to effectively translate our knowledge about HER2 into practical diagnostic schemes for the lower spectrum of expression are available. Our investigation is centered on the significance of distinguishing between an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0 and score 1+ in light of the clinical implications now apparent, as patients with HER2-low breast cancer become eligible for trastuzumab-deruxtecan treatment. Furthermore, we discuss the definition of HER2-low beyond its conventional boundaries and assess the reliability of established diagnostic procedures designed at a time when therapeutic perspectives were non-existent for these cases. In this regard, we examine potential complementary technologies, such as gene expression analysis and liquid biopsy. Ultimately, we consider the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of digital pathology and its integration into HER2 testing, with a particular emphasis on its application in the context of HER2-low breast cancer.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of modern technology has significantly driven progress in various IT-related activities, resulting in a substantial increase in internet penetration rates, particularly among college students. The utilization of the internet has become one of the most essential tools in our modern society. However, internet addiction (IA) has emerged as a serious concern, particularly among college students, adversely affecting academic performance and having significant psychological and psychiatric implications. The aim of the current study was to determine the impact of physical exercise, gender and academic year on IA among college students. In the present study, we investigated internet usage, engagement in sports activities, and academic performance among college students from Western, Middle, and Eastern regions of Chinese universities. It's noteworthy that most of the respondents were freshmen. Our findings indicate that freshmen students were more susceptible to experiencing IA. Approximately 75% of students engaged in leisure sports activities, revealing an inverse correlation between sports activity and IA. This correlation aligns with the level of sports involvement, emphasizing the potential benefits of physical activity in mitigating IA. However, our study did not uncover any correlation between geographic location and the occurrence of IA, nor did it find differences between medical and non-medical students. Furthermore, our study revealed no significant variations in IA among students from different ethnic backgrounds. The underlying mechanism of IA is being currently determined. Our data suggest that physical exercise, gender, and academic year have a significant impact on IA among college students.

Title: Advances in machine learning-based bacteria analysis for forensic identification: identity, ethnicity, and site of occurrence.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xu Geyao, Teng Xianzhuo, Gao Xing-Hua, Zhang Li, Yan Hongwei, Qi Rui-Qun
Abstract: When faced with an unidentified body, identifying the victim can be challenging, particularly if physical characteristics are obscured or masked. In recent years, microbiological analysis in forensic science has emerged as a cutting-edge technology. It not only exhibits individual specificity, distinguishing different human biotraces from various sites of occurrence (e.g., gastrointestinal, oral, skin, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts), each hosting distinct bacterial species, but also offers insights into the accident's location and the surrounding environment. The integration of machine learning with microbiomics provides a substantial improvement in classifying bacterial species compares to traditional sequencing techniques. This review discusses the use of machine learning algorithms such as RF, SVM, ANN, DNN, regression, and BN for the detection and identification of various bacteria, including <i>Bacillus anthracis, Acetobacter aceti, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus</i>, among others. Deep leaning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models and derivatives, are also employed to predict the victim's age, gender, lifestyle, and racial characteristics. It is anticipated that big data analytics and artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role in advancing forensic microbiology in the future.

Abstract: <b>Background and purpose:</b> Intellectual disability-7 (MRD7) is a subtype disorder of intellectual disability (MRD) involving feeding difficulties, hypoactivity, and febrile seizures at an age of early onset, then progressive intellectual and physical development deterioration. We purposed to identify the underlying causative genetic factors of three individuals in each Chinese family who presented with symptoms of intellectual disability and facial dysmorphic features. We provided prenatal diagnosis for the three families and genetic counseling for the prevention of this disease. <b>Methods:</b> We collected retrospective clinical diagnostic evidence for the three probands in our study, which included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), electroencephalogram (EEG), and intelligence tests for the three probands in our study. Genetic investigation of the probands and their next of kin was performed by Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR technologies were then used as the next step to verify the variants confirmed with Trio-WES for the three families. Moreover, we performed amniocentesis to explore the state of the three pathogenic variants in the fetuses by prenatal molecular genetic diagnosis at an appropriate gestational period for the three families. <b>Results:</b> The three probands and one fetus were clinically diagnosed with microcephaly and exhibited intellectual developmental disability, postnatal feeding difficulties, and facial dysmorphic features. Combining probands' clinical manifestations, Trio-WES uncovered the three heterozygous variants in <i>DYRK1A</i>: a novel variant exon3_exon4del p.(Gly4_Asn109del), a novel variant c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*), and a previously presented but rare pathogenic variant c.1309C>T p.(Arg437*) (NM_001396.5) in three families, respectively. In light of the updated American College of Medical Genetic and Genomics (ACMG) criterion, the variant of exon3_exon4del and c.1159C>T were both classified as likely pathogenic (PSV1+PM6), while c1309C>T was identified as pathogenic (PVS1+PS2_Moderate+PM2). Considering clinical features and molecular testimony, the three probands were confirmed diagnosed with MRD7. These three discovered variants were considered as the three causal mutations for MRD7. Prenatal diagnosis detected the heterozygous dominant variant of c.1159C>T p.(Gln387*) in one of the fetuses, indicating a significant probability of MRD7, subsequently the gestation was intervened by the parents' determination and professional obstetrical operation. On the other side, prenatal molecular genetic testing revealed wild-type alleles in the other two fetuses, and their parents both decided to sustain the gestation. <b>Conclusion:</b> We identified two novel and one rare mutation in <i>DYRK1A</i> which has broadened the spectrum of <i>DYRK1A</i> and provided evidence for the diagnosis of MRD7 at the molecular level. Besides, this study has supported the three families with MRD7 to determine the causative genetic factors efficiently and provide concise genetic counseling for the three families by using Trio-WES technology.

Title: Update on current diagnosis and management of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
Year: 2023
Authors: Pavlidis Efstathios T, Galanis Ioannis N, Pavlidis Theodoros E
Abstract: Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma has a favorable prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of over 95%. However, the undifferentiated or anaplastic type accounting for < 0.2%, usually in elderly individuals, exhibits a dismal prognosis with rapid growth and disappointing outcomes. It is the most aggressive form of thyroid carcinoma, with a median survival of 5 mo and poor quality of life (airway obstruction, dysphagia, hoarseness, persistent pain). Early diagnosis and staging are crucial. Diagnostic tools include biopsy (fine needle aspiration, core needle, open surgery), high-resolution ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, [(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomo-graphy/computed tomography, liquid biopsy and microRNAs. The <i>BRAF</i> gene (<i>BRAF-V600E</i> and <i>BRAF</i> wild type) is the most often found molecular factor. Others include the genes <i>RET, KRAS, HRAS,</i> and <i>NRAS</i>. Recent management policy is based on surgery, even debulking, chemotherapy (cisplatin or doxorubicin), radiotherapy (adjuvant or definitive), targeted biological agents and immunotherapy. The last two options constitute novel hopeful management modalities improving the overall survival in these otherwise condemned patients. Anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody immunotherapy, stem cell targeted therapies, nanotechnology achievements and artificial intelligence imple-mentation provide novel promising alternatives. Genetic mutations determine molecular pathways, thus indicating novel treatment strategies such as anti-BRAF, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor. Treatment with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in cases with <i>BRAF-V600E</i> gene mutations and is currently the standard care. This neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery ensures a two-year overall survival of 80%. Prognostic factors for improved outcomes have been found to be younger age, earlier tumor stage and radiation therapy. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary, and the therapeutic plan should be individualized based on surveillance and epidemiology end results.

Title: Sarcopenia and diabetes-induced dementia risk.
Year: 2024
Authors: Sun Mingyang, Lu Zhongyuan, Chen Wan-Ming, Wu Szu-Yuan, Zhang Jiaqiang
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate whether sarcopenia independently increases the risk of diabetes-induced dementia in elderly individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study cohort consisted of a large sample of elderly individuals aged 60 years and above, who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus between 2008 and 2018. To minimize potential bias and achieve covariate balance between the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups, we employed propensity score matching. Various statistical analyses, including Cox regression models to assess dementia risk and associations, competing risk analysis to account for mortality and Poisson regression analysis for incidence rates, were used. Before propensity score matching, the study included 406 573 elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, with 20 674 in the sarcopenia group. Following propensity score matching, the analysis included a total of 41 294 individuals, with 20 647 in the sarcopenia group and 20 647 in the non-sarcopenia group. Prior to propensity score matching, elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with sarcopenia exhibited a significantly higher risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.17). After propensity score matching, the risk remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.21). Incidence rates of dementia were notably higher in the sarcopenia group both before and after propensity score matching, underscoring the importance of sarcopenia as an independent risk factor. Our study highlights sarcopenia as an independent risk factor for diabetes-induced dementia in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Advanced age, female gender, lower income levels, rural residency, higher adapted diabetes complication severity index and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores and various comorbidities were associated with increased dementia risk. Notably, the use of statins was linked to a reduced risk of dementia. This research underscores the need to identify and address modifiable risk factors for dementia in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, offering valuable insights for targeted interventions and healthcare policies.

Title: TetCNN: Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes.
Year: 2023
Authors: Farazi Mohammad, Yang Zhangsihao, Zhu Wenhui, Qiu Peijie, Wang Yalin
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been broadly studied on images, videos, graphs, and triangular meshes. However, it has seldom been studied on tetrahedral meshes. Given the merits of using volumetric meshes in applications like brain image analysis, we introduce a novel interpretable graph CNN framework for the tetrahedral mesh structure. Inspired by ChebyNet, our model exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of 3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally, adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used unitary cortical thickness, graph Laplacian, and point cloud representation.

Title: Nuclear medicine radiomics in digestive system tumors: Concept, applications, challenges, and future perspectives.
Year: 2023
Authors: Huang Wenpeng, Tao Zihao, Younis Muhsin H, Cai Weibo, Kang Lei
Abstract: Radiomics aims to develop novel biomarkers and provide relevant deeper subvisual information about pathology, immunophenotype, and tumor microenvironment. It uses automated or semiautomated quantitative analysis of high-dimensional images to improve characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis. Recent years have seen a rapid increase in radiomics applications in nuclear medicine, leading to some promising research results in digestive system oncology, which have been driven by big data analysis and the development of artificial intelligence. Although radiomics advances one step further toward the non-invasive precision medical analysis, it is still a step away from clinical application and faces many challenges. This review article summarizes the available literature on digestive system tumors regarding radiomics in nuclear medicine. First, we describe the workflow and steps involved in radiomics analysis. Subsequently, we discuss the progress in clinical application regarding the utilization of radiomics for distinguishing between various diseases and evaluating their prognosis, and demonstrate how radiomics advances this field. Finally, we offer our viewpoint on how the field can progress by addressing the challenges facing clinical implementation.

Title: DeepNeuropePred: A robust and universal tool to predict cleavage sites from neuropeptide precursors by protein language model.
Year: 2024
Authors: Wang Lei, Zeng Zilu, Xue Zhidong, Wang Yan
Abstract: Neuropeptides play critical roles in many biological processes such as growth, learning, memory, metabolism, and neuronal differentiation. A few approaches have been reported for predicting neuropeptides that are cleaved from precursor protein sequences. However, these models for cleavage site prediction of precursors were developed using a limited number of neuropeptide precursor datasets and simple precursors representation models. In addition, a universal method for predicting neuropeptide cleavage sites that can be applied to all species is still lacking. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning method called DeepNeuropePred, using a combination of pre-trained language model and Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and predicting the neuropeptide cleavage sites from precursors. To demonstrate the model's effectiveness and robustness, we evaluated the performance of DeepNeuropePred and four models from the NeuroPred server in the independent dataset and our model achieved the highest AUC score (0.916), which are 6.9%, 7.8%, 8.8%, and 10.9% higher than Mammalian (0.857), insects (0.850), Mollusc (0.842) and Motif (0.826), respectively. For the convenience of researchers, we provide a web server (http://isyslab.info/NeuroPepV2/deepNeuropePred.jsp).

Title: Novel oil spill indices for sentinel-2 imagery: A case study of natural seepage in Qaruh Island, Kuwait.
Year: 2024
Authors: Zakzouk Mohamed, El-Magd Islam Abou, Ali Elham M, Abdulaziz Abdulaziz M, Rehman Amjad, Saba Tanzila
Abstract: Oil spills are a paramount and immediate challenge affecting marine ecosystems globally. Effective and timely monitoring tools, such as oil detection indices, offer a swift means to track oil spill spread across vast oceanic expanses. Moreover, these indices enhance data clarity, making it more conducive for machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study leverages the natural seepage occurring around Qaruh Island, Kuwait as a unique context for the spectral analysis of oil spills using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery due to repeated occurrences in the same region. This research evaluated 859 single band and 455 multichannel combinations to identify the most effective combinations in oil-water separability, employing the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance measure as a key metric. Bands 1, 2, 3, 8A, 11, and 12 consistently featured among the top-performing indices combinations <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>11</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>11</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>;</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>11</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>;</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>12</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>;</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mn>8</mn><mi>A</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math> affirming the significant effect of oil spills on visible, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands. Notably, the indices developed in this study outperformed those from prior research in terms of suitability to unsupervised classification algorithms. A significant conclusion of this study is that incorporating a higher number of bands in the analysis did not correlate with an increase in JM values, suggesting that the selection of specific, informative bands is more critical than the volume of input data. These findings underscore the indispensable role of Sentinel-2 imagery in environmental investigations and highlight the potential for focused, efficient analysis using strategic band combinations for effective oil spill detection.•This study identified optimized Sentinel-2 band combinations for oil-water separability, benefiting from naturally occurring spills around Qaruh Island.•The proposed indices outperformed the previous indices for oil spill visualization and clustering.•The new indices highlighted the critical role of specific band selection over the volume of input data for effective oil spill detection.

Title: SAXS/WAXS data of conformationally flexible ribose binding protein.
Year: 2024
Authors: Choudhury Jagrity, Yonezawa Kento, Anu Anu, Shimizu Nobutaka, Chaudhuri Barnali
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction methods, such as Alphafold2, can predict structures of folded proteins with reasonable accuracy. However, Alphafold2 provides a static view of a protein, which does not show the conformational variability of the protein, domain movement in a multi-domain protein, or ligand-induced conformational changes it might undergo in solution. Small-angle X-ay scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) are solution techniques that can aid in integrative modeling of conformationally flexible proteins, or in validating their predicted ensemble structures. While SAXS is sensitive to global structural features, WAXS can expand the scope of structural modeling by including information about local structural changes. We present SAXS and WAXS datasets obtained from conformationally flexible d-ribose binding protein (RBP) from <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the ribose bound and unbound forms. SAXS/WAXS datasets of RBP provided here may aid in method development efforts for more accurate prediction of structural ensembles of conformationally flexible proteins, and their conformational changes.

Title: Frequency modulation of terahertz microcavity via strong coupling with plasmonic resonators.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xu Xitan, Lu Yao, Huang Yibo, Zhou Xu, Ma Ruobin, Xiong Hao, Li Meili, Wu Qiang, Xu Jingjun
Abstract: Tunable terahertz (THz) microcavities are crucial for the compact on-chip THz devices, aiming to future cloud-based computing, and artificial-intelligence technologies. However, the solutions to effectively modulate THz microcavities remain elusive. Strong coupling has been widely demonstrated in many configurations at different ambient conditions to date and may serve as a promising tool to modulate THz microcavities. Here, we schematically design a microcavity-plasmon hybrid system, and propose an effective approach to modulating the resonant frequencies of THz microcavities by the microcavity-resonator strong coupling. In this case, we observed the strongly coupling states, where the resultant two-polariton branches exhibit an anti-crossing splitting in the frequency domain, experimentally exhibiting a ∼6.2% frequency modulation to the microcavity compared to the uncoupled case. This work provides an efficient approach to modulating chip-scale THz microcavities, thereby facilitating the development and application of compact THz integrated devices, further empowering the evolution of future information processing and intelligent computing system.

Title: Im-SCC-FRET: improved single-cell-based calibration of a FRET system.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiang Xinzhuo, Hu Min, Cao Gengqiang, Liu Zhi, Wu Ge, Zhuang Zhengfei, Chen Tongsheng
Abstract: We recently developed a SCC-FRET (single-cell-based calibration of a FRET system) method to quantify spectral crosstalk correction parameters (β and δ) and system calibration parameters (G and k) of a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system by imaging a single cell expressing a standard FRET plasmid with known FRET efficiency (E) and donor-acceptor concentration ratio (R<sub>C</sub>) (Liu et al., Opt. Express30, 29063 (2022)10.1364/OE.459861). Here we improved the SCC-FRET method (named as Im-SCC-FRET) to simultaneously obtain β, δ, G, k and the acceptor-to-donor extinction coefficient ratio (<i>ε</i> <sub>A</sub> <i>ε</i> <sub>D</sub>), which is a key parameter to calculate the acceptor-centric FRET efficiency (E<sub>A</sub>), of a FRET system when the range of β and δ values is set as 0-1. In Im-SCC-FRET, the target function is changed from the sum of absolute values to the sum of squares according to the least squares method, and the initial value of β and δ estimated by the integral but not the maximum value spectral overlap between fluorophore and filter. Compared with SCC-FRET, the experimental results demonstrate that Im-SCC-FRET can obtain more accurate and stable results for β, δ, G, and k, and add the ratio <i>ε</i> <sub>A</sub> <i>ε</i> <sub>D</sub>, which is necessary for the FRET hybrid assay. Im-SCC-FRET reduces the complexity of experiment preparation and opens up a promising avenue for developing an intelligent FRET correction system.

Title: Visible light sensing based on shadow features using multi-scale region convolutional neural network.
Year: 2023
Authors: Du Xiaoxiao, Zhang Yanyu, Wang Chao, Li Dun, Zhu Yijun
Abstract: There are various production items in the industrial internet of things (IIoT) environment, such as pedestrians, robots, automated automated guided vehicles, etc. The practice industrial environment requires simultaneous communication and sensing of production items to achieve intelligent production and control. Thus, sensing methods not only require the integration of communication but also achieve sensing tasks such as recognition and positioning. Compared with traditional sensing media, visible light sensing has the advantages of high-speed communication, high sensing accuracy, and security, low energy consumption, and has become a potential sensing technology. Based on the strong directivity of visible light spatial radiation and the consistency of light intensity and position, this paper proposes a multi-scale visible light sensing-region convolutional neural network (VLS-RCNN) framework based on shadow features for multiple target sensing. The framework enables the recognition and positioning to use shared visible light shadow features to assist each other, and the multi-scale compensation strategy of the shadow region makes the framework more robust. The simulation results show that positioning results in the sensing area improve the recognition accuracy. The recognition results also reduce the positioning error without additional overhead. Therefore, this paper provides a new perspective for the sensing technology in the future IIoT, which should be considered to sense objects of interest by utilizing the inherent characteristics of visible light.

Title: A machine learning route between band mapping and band structure.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xian R Patrick, Stimper Vincent, Zacharias Marios, Dendzik Maciej, Dong Shuo, Beaulieu Samuel, Schölkopf Bernhard, Wolf Martin, Rettig Laurenz, Carbogno Christian, Bauer Stefan, Ernstorfer Ralph
Abstract: The electronic band structure and crystal structure are the two complementary identifiers of solid-state materials. Although convenient instruments and reconstruction algorithms have made large, empirical, crystal structure databases possible, extracting the quasiparticle dispersion (closely related to band structure) from photoemission band mapping data is currently limited by the available computational methods. To cope with the growing size and scale of photoemission data, here we develop a pipeline including probabilistic machine learning and the associated data processing, optimization and evaluation methods for band-structure reconstruction, leveraging theoretical calculations. The pipeline reconstructs all 14 valence bands of a semiconductor and shows excellent performance on benchmarks and other materials datasets. The reconstruction uncovers previously inaccessible momentum-space structural information on both global and local scales, while realizing a path towards integration with materials science databases. Our approach illustrates the potential of combining machine learning and domain knowledge for scalable feature extraction in multidimensional data.

Title: Supervised learning of a chemistry functional with damped dispersion.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Yiwei, Zhang Cheng, Liu Zhonghua, Truhlar Donald G, Wang Ying, He Xiao
Abstract: Kohn-Sham density functional theory is widely used in chemistry, but no functional can accurately predict the whole range of chemical properties, although recent progress by some doubly hybrid functionals comes close. Here, we optimized a singly hybrid functional called CF22D with higher across-the-board accuracy for chemistry than most of the existing non-doubly hybrid functionals by using a flexible functional form that combines a global hybrid meta-nonseparable gradient approximation that depends on density and occupied orbitals with a damped dispersion term that depends on geometry. We optimized this energy functional by using a large database and performance-triggered iterative supervised training. We combined several databases to create a very large, combined database whose use demonstrated the good performance of CF22D on barrier heights, isomerization energies, thermochemistry, noncovalent interactions, radical and nonradical chemistry, small and large systems, simple and complex systems and transition-metal chemistry.

Title: Domain-agnostic predictions of nanoscale interactions in proteins and nanoparticles.
Year: 2023
Authors: Saldinger Jacob Charles, Raymond Matt, Elvati Paolo, Violi Angela
Abstract: Although challenging, the accurate and rapid prediction of nanoscale interactions has broad applications for numerous biological processes and material properties. While several models have been developed to predict the interaction of specific biological components, they use system-specific information that hinders their application to more general materials. Here we present NeCLAS, a general and efficient machine learning pipeline that predicts the location of nanoscale interactions, providing human-intelligible predictions. NeCLAS outperforms current nanoscale prediction models for generic nanoparticles up to 10-20 nm, reproducing interactions for biological and non-biological systems. Two aspects contribute to these results: a low-dimensional representation of nanoparticles and molecules (to reduce the effect of data uncertainty), and environmental features (to encode the physicochemical neighborhood at multiple scales). This framework has several applications, from basic research to rapid prototyping and design in nanobiotechnology.

Title: Fast evaluation of the adsorption energy of organic molecules on metals via graph neural networks.
Year: 2023
Authors: Pablo-García Sergio, Morandi Santiago, Vargas-Hernández Rodrigo A, Jorner Kjell, Ivković Žarko, López Núria, Aspuru-Guzik Alán
Abstract: Modeling in heterogeneous catalysis requires the extensive evaluation of the energy of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. This is done via density functional theory but for large organic molecules it requires enormous computational time, compromising the viability of the approach. Here we present GAME-Net, a graph neural network to quickly evaluate the adsorption energy. GAME-Net is trained on a well-balanced chemically diverse dataset with C<sub>1-4</sub> molecules with functional groups including N, O, S and C<sub>6-10</sub> aromatic rings. The model yields a mean absolute error of 0.18 eV on the test set and is 6 orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. Applied to biomass and plastics (up to 30 heteroatoms), adsorption energies are predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.016 eV per atom. The framework represents a tool for the fast screening of catalytic materials, particularly for systems that cannot be simulated by traditional methods.

Title: Efficient and accurate large library ligand docking with KarmaDock.

Abstract: Ligand docking is one of the core technologies in structure-based virtual screening for drug discovery. However, conventional docking tools and existing deep learning tools may suffer from limited performance in terms of speed, pose quality and binding affinity accuracy. Here we propose KarmaDock, a deep learning approach for ligand docking that integrates the functions of docking acceleration, binding pose generation and correction, and binding strength estimation. The three-stage model consists of the following components: (1) encoders for the protein and ligand to learn the representations of intramolecular interactions; (2) E(n) equivariant graph neural networks with self-attention to update the ligand pose based on both protein-ligand and intramolecular interactions, followed by post-processing to ensure chemically plausible structures; (3) a mixture density network for scoring the binding strength. KarmaDock was validated on four benchmark datasets and tested in a real-world virtual screening project that successfully identified experiment-validated active inhibitors of leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK).

Title: Strategy evolution on dynamic networks.
Year: 2023
Authors: Su Qi, McAvoy Alex, Plotkin Joshua B
Abstract: Models of strategy evolution on static networks help us understand how population structure can promote the spread of traits like cooperation. One key mechanism is the formation of altruistic spatial clusters, where neighbors of a cooperative individual are likely to reciprocate, which protects prosocial traits from exploitation. However, most real-world interactions are ephemeral and subject to exogenous restructuring, so that social networks change over time. Strategic behavior on dynamic networks is difficult to study, and much less is known about the resulting evolutionary dynamics. Here we provide an analytical treatment of cooperation on dynamic networks, allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We show that transitions among a large class of network structures can favor the spread of cooperation, even if each individual social network would inhibit cooperation when static. Furthermore, we show that spatial heterogeneity tends to inhibit cooperation, whereas temporal heterogeneity tends to promote it. Dynamic networks can have profound effects on the evolution of prosocial traits, even when individuals have no agency over network structures.

Title: Spatial planning of urban communities via deep reinforcement learning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zheng Yu, Lin Yuming, Zhao Liang, Wu Tinghai, Jin Depeng, Li Yong
Abstract: Effective spatial planning of urban communities plays a critical role in the sustainable development of cities. Despite the convenience brought by geographic information systems and computer-aided design, determining the layout of land use and roads still heavily relies on human experts. Here we propose an artificial intelligence urban-planning model to generate spatial plans for urban communities. To overcome the difficulty of diverse and irregular urban geography, we construct a graph to describe the topology of cities in arbitrary forms and formulate urban planning as a sequential decision-making problem on the graph. To tackle the challenge of the vast solution space, we develop a reinforcement learning model based on graph neural networks. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world communities demonstrate that our computational model outperforms plans designed by human experts in objective metrics and that it can generate spatial plans responding to different circumstances and needs. We also propose a human-artificial intelligence collaborative workflow of urban planning, in which human designers can substantially benefit from our model to be more productive, generating more efficient spatial plans with much less time. Our method demonstrates the great potential of computational urban planning and paves the way for more explorations in leveraging computational methodologies to solve challenging real-world problems in urban science.

Authors: Yu Jie, Li Zhaojun, Chen Geng, Kong Xiangtai, Hu Jie, Wang Dingyan, Cao Duanhua, Li Yanbei, Huo Ruifeng, Wang Gang, Liu Xiaohong, Jiang Hualiang, Li Xutong, Luo Xiaomin, Zheng Mingyue
Abstract: Structure-based lead optimization is an open challenge in drug discovery, which is still largely driven by hypotheses and depends on the experience of medicinal chemists. Here we propose a pairwise binding comparison network (PBCNet) based on a physics-informed graph attention mechanism, specifically tailored for ranking the relative binding affinity among congeneric ligands. Benchmarking on two held-out sets (provided by Schrödinger and Merck) containing over 460 ligands and 16 targets, PBCNet demonstrated substantial advantages in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Equipped with a fine-tuning operation, the performance of PBCNet reaches that of Schrödinger's FEP+, which is much more computationally intensive and requires substantial expert intervention. A further simulation-based experiment showed that active learning-optimized PBCNet may accelerate lead optimization campaigns by 473%. Finally, for the convenience of users, a web service for PBCNet is established to facilitate complex relative binding affinity prediction through an easy-to-operate graphical interface.

Title: Learning on topological surface and geometric structure for 3D molecular generation.

Abstract: Highly effective de novo design is a grand challenge of computer-aided drug discovery. Practical structure-specific three-dimensional molecule generations have started to emerge in recent years, but most approaches treat the target structure as a conditional input to bias the molecule generation and do not fully learn the detailed atomic interactions that govern the molecular conformation and stability of the binding complexes. The omission of these fine details leads to many models having difficulty in outputting reasonable molecules for a variety of therapeutic targets. Here, to address this challenge, we formulate a model, called SurfGen, that designs molecules in a fashion closely resembling the figurative key-and-lock principle. SurfGen comprises two equivariant neural networks, Geodesic-GNN and Geoatom-GNN, which capture the topological interactions on the pocket surface and the spatial interaction between ligand atoms and surface nodes, respectively. SurfGen outperforms other methods in a number of benchmarks, and its high sensitivity on the pocket structures enables an effective generative-model-based solution to the thorny issue of mutation-induced drug resistance.

Title: Urban dynamics through the lens of human mobility.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xu Yanyan, Olmos Luis E, Mateo David, Hernando Alberto, Yang Xiaokang, González Marta C
Abstract: The urban spatial structure represents the distribution of public and private spaces in cities and how people move within them. Although it usually evolves slowly, it can change quickly during large-scale emergency events, as well as due to urban renewal in rapidly developing countries. Here we present an approach to delineate such urban dynamics in quasi-real time through a human mobility metric, the mobility centrality index ΔKS. As a case study, we tracked the urban dynamics of eleven Spanish cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results revealed that their structures became more monocentric during the lockdown in the first wave, but kept their regular spatial structures during the second wave. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of mobility from home, we also introduce a dimensionless metric, KS<sub>HBT</sub>, which measures the extent of home-based travel and provides statistical insights into the transmission of COVID-19. By utilizing individual mobility data, our metrics enable the detection of changes in the urban spatial structure.

Title: Interpretable neural architecture search and transfer learning for understanding CRISPR-Cas9 off-target enzymatic reactions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Zijun, Lamson Adam R, Shelley Michael, Troyanskaya Olga
Abstract: Finely tuned enzymatic pathways control cellular processes, and their dysregulation can lead to disease. Developing predictive and interpretable models for these pathways is challenging because of the complexity of the pathways and of the cellular and genomic contexts. Here we introduce Elektrum, a deep learning framework that addresses these challenges with data-driven and biophysically interpretable models for determining the kinetics of biochemical systems. First, it uses in vitro kinetic assays to rapidly hypothesize an ensemble of high-quality kinetically interpretable neural networks (KINNs) that predict reaction rates. It then employs a transfer learning step, where the KINNs are inserted as intermediary layers into deeper convolutional neural networks, fine-tuning the predictions for reaction-dependent in vivo outcomes. We apply Elektrum to predict CRISPR-Cas9 off-target editing probabilities and demonstrate that Elektrum achieves improved performance, regularizes neural network architectures and maintains physical interpretability.

Title: Deep contrastive learning of molecular conformation for efficient property prediction.
Year: 2023
Authors: Park Yang Jeong, Kim HyunGi, Jo Jeonghee, Yoon Sungroh
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning algorithms provide accurate prediction of high-level quantum-chemical molecular properties. However, their inputs must be constrained to the same quantum-chemical level of geometric relaxation as the training dataset, limiting their flexibility. Adopting alternative cost-effective conformation generative methods introduces domain-shift problems, deteriorating prediction accuracy. Here we propose a deep contrastive learning-based domain-adaptation method called Local Atomic environment Contrastive Learning (LACL). LACL learns to alleviate the disparities in distribution between the two geometric conformations by comparing different conformation-generation methods. We found that LACL forms a domain-agnostic latent space that encapsulates the semantics of an atom's local atomic environment. LACL achieves quantum-chemical accuracy while circumventing the geometric relaxation bottleneck and could enable future application scenarios such as inverse molecular engineering and large-scale screening. Our approach is also generalizable from small organic molecules to long chains of biological and pharmacological molecules.

Title: Evolving scattering networks for engineering disorder.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yu Sunkyu
Abstract: Network science provides a powerful tool for unraveling the complexities of social, technological and biological systems. Constructing networks using wave phenomena is also of great interest in devising advanced hardware for machine learning, as shown in optical neural networks. Although most wave-based networks have employed static network models, the impact of evolving models in network science provides strong motivation to apply dynamical network modeling to wave physics. Here the concept of evolving scattering networks for scattering phenomena is developed. The network is defined by links, node degrees and their evolution processes modeling multi-particle interferences, which directly determine scattering from disordered materials. I demonstrate the concept by examining network-based material classification, microstructure screening and preferential attachment in evolutions, which are applied to stealthy hyperuniformity. The results enable independent control of scattering from different length scales, revealing superdense material phases in short-range order. The proposed concept provides a bridge between wave physics and network science to resolve multiscale material complexities and open-system material design.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient molecular spectra simulations are crucial for substance discovery and structure identification. However, the conventional approach of relying on the quantum chemistry is cost intensive, which hampers efficiency. Here we develop DetaNet, a deep-learning model combining E(3)-equivariance group and self-attention mechanism to predict molecular spectra with improved efficiency and accuracy. By passing high-order geometric tensorial messages, DetaNet is able to generate a wide variety of molecular properties, including scalars, vectors, and second- and third-order tensors-all at the accuracy of quantum chemistry calculations. Based on this we developed generalized modules to predict four important types of molecular spectra, namely infrared, Raman, ultraviolet-visible, and <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance, taking the QM9S dataset containing 130,000 molecular species as an example. By speeding up the prediction of molecular spectra at quantum chemical accuracy, DetaNet could help progress toward real-time structural identification using spectroscopic measurements.

Title: Highly secreted tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase 1 as a potential theranostic target for hypercytokinemic severe sepsis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kim Yoon Tae, Huh Jin Won, Choi Yun Hui, Yoon Hee Kyeong, Nguyen Tram Tt, Chun Eunho, Jeong Geunyeol, Park Sunyoung, Ahn Sungwoo, Lee Won-Kyu, Noh Young-Woock, Lee Kyoung Sun, Ahn Hee-Sung, Lee Cheolju, Lee Sang Min, Kim Kyung Su, Suh Gil Joon, Jeon Kyeongman, Kim Sunghoon, Jin Mirim
Abstract: Despite intensive clinical and scientific efforts, the mortality rate of sepsis remains high due to the lack of precise biomarkers for patient stratification and therapeutic guidance. Secreted human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (WARS1), an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 against infection, activates the genes that signify the hyperinflammatory sepsis phenotype. High plasma WARS1 levels stratified the early death of critically ill patients with sepsis, along with elevated levels of cytokines, chemokines, and lactate, as well as increased numbers of absolute neutrophils and monocytes, and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. These symptoms were recapitulated in severely ill septic mice with hypercytokinemia. Further, injection of WARS1 into mildly septic mice worsened morbidity and mortality. We created an anti-human WARS1-neutralizing antibody that suppresses proinflammatory cytokine expression in marmosets with endotoxemia. Administration of this antibody into severe septic mice attenuated cytokine storm, organ failure, and early mortality. With antibiotics, the antibody almost completely prevented fatalities. These data imply that blood-circulating WARS1-guided anti-WARS1 therapy may provide a novel theranostic strategy for life-threatening systemic hyperinflammatory sepsis.

Title: Dendritic excitability controls overdispersion.
Year: 2023
Authors: Friedenberger Zachary, Naud Richard
Abstract: The brain is an intricate assembly of intercommunicating neurons whose input-output function is only partially understood. The role of active dendrites in shaping spiking responses, in particular, is unclear. Although existing models account for active dendrites and spiking responses, they are too complex to analyze analytically and demand long stochastic simulations. Here we combine cable and renewal theory to describe how input fluctuations shape the response of neuronal ensembles with active dendrites. We found that dendritic input readily and potently controls interspike interval dispersion. This phenomenon can be understood by considering that neurons display three fundamental operating regimes: one mean-driven regime and two fluctuation-driven regimes. We show that these results are expected to appear for a wide range of dendritic properties and verify predictions of the model in experimental data. These findings have implications for the role of interspike interval dispersion in learning and for theories of attractor states.

Title: Unbiased organism-agnostic and highly sensitive signal peptide predictor with deep protein language model.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shen Junbo, Yu Qinze, Chen Shenyang, Tan Qingxiong, Li Jingchen, Li Yu
Abstract: Signal peptides (SPs) are essential to target and transfer transmembrane and secreted proteins to the correct positions. Many existing computational tools for predicting SPs disregard the extreme data imbalance problem and rely on additional group information of proteins. Here we introduce Unbiased Organism-agnostic Signal Peptide Network (USPNet), an SP classification and cleavage-site prediction deep learning method. Extensive experimental results show that USPNet substantially outperforms previous methods on classification performance by 10%. An SP-discovering pipeline with USPNet is designed to explore unprecedented SPs from metagenomic data. It reveals 347 SP candidates, with the lowest sequence identity between our candidates and the closest SP in the training dataset at only 13%. In addition, the template modeling scores between candidates and SPs in the training set are mostly above 0.8. The results showcase that USPNet has learnt the SP structure with raw amino acid sequences and the large protein language model, thereby enabling the discovery of unknown SPs.

Title: GRAPE for fast and scalable graph processing and random-walk-based embedding.
Year: 2023
Authors: Cappelletti Luca, Fontana Tommaso, Casiraghi Elena, Ravanmehr Vida, Callahan Tiffany J, Cano Carlos, Joachimiak Marcin P, Mungall Christopher J, Robinson Peter N, Reese Justin, Valentini Giorgio
Abstract: Graph representation learning methods opened new avenues for addressing complex, real-world problems represented by graphs. However, many graphs used in these applications comprise millions of nodes and billions of edges and are beyond the capabilities of current methods and software implementations. We present GRAPE (Graph Representation Learning, Prediction and Evaluation), a software resource for graph processing and embedding that is able to scale with big graphs by using specialized and smart data structures, algorithms, and a fast parallel implementation of random-walk-based methods. Compared with state-of-the-art software resources, GRAPE shows an improvement of orders of magnitude in empirical space and time complexity, as well as competitive edge- and node-label prediction performance. GRAPE comprises approximately 1.7 million well-documented lines of Python and Rust code and provides 69 node-embedding methods, 25 inference models, a collection of efficient graph-processing utilities, and over 80,000 graphs from the literature and other sources. Standardized interfaces allow a seamless integration of third-party libraries, while ready-to-use and modular pipelines permit an easy-to-use evaluation of graph-representation-learning methods, therefore also positioning GRAPE as a software resource that performs a fair comparison between methods and libraries for graph processing and embedding.

Title: Structural insight into the allosteric inhibition of human sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1 by XIP and SEA0400.
Year: 2024
Authors: Dong Yanli, Yu Zhuoya, Li Yue, Huang Bo, Bai Qinru, Gao Yiwei, Chen Qihao, Li Na, He Lingli, Zhao Yan
Abstract: Sodium-calcium exchanger proteins influence calcium homeostasis in many cell types and participate in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Here, we elucidate the cryo-EM structure of the human Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCX1.3 in the presence of a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. Conserved ion-coordinating residues are exposed on the cytoplasmic face of NCX1.3, indicating that the observed structure is stabilized in an inward-facing conformation. We show how regulatory calcium-binding domains (CBDs) assemble with the ion-translocation transmembrane domain (TMD). The exchanger-inhibitory peptide (XIP) is trapped within a groove between the TMD and CBD2 and predicted to clash with gating helices TMs<sup>1/6</sup> at the outward-facing state, thus hindering conformational transition and promoting inactivation of the transporter. A bound SEA0400 molecule stiffens helix TM2ab and affects conformational rearrangements of TM2ab that are associated with the ion-exchange reaction, thus allosterically attenuating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake activity of NCX1.3.

Title: PA-Net: A phase attention network fusing venous and arterial phase features of CT images for liver tumor segmentation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Zhenbing, Hou Junfeng, Pan Xipeng, Zhang Ruojie, Shi Zhenwei
Abstract: Liver cancer seriously threatens human health. In clinical diagnosis, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images provide important supplementary information for accurate liver tumor segmentation. However, most of the existing methods of liver tumor automatic segmentation focus only on single-phase image features. And the existing multi-modal methods have limited segmentation effect due to the redundancy of fusion features. In addition, the spatial misalignment of multi-phase images causes feature interference.

Year: 2023
Authors: Lu Lu, Wang Lu, Liu Ruyi, Zhang Yingbin, Zheng Xinqiang, Lu Jianliang, Wang Xinchao, Ye Jianhui
Abstract: The key components dominating the quality of green tea and black tea are still unclear. Here, we respectively produced green and black teas in March and June, and investigated the correlations between sensory quality and chemical compositions of dry teas by multivariate statistics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence algorithm. The key chemical indices were screened out to establish tea sensory quality-prediction models based on the result of OPLS-DA and random forest, namely 4 flavonol glycosides of green tea and 8 indices of black tea (4 pigments, epigallocatechin, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside, ratios of caffeine/total catechins and epi/non-epi catechins). Compared with OPLS-DA and random forest, the support vector machine model had good sensory quality-prediction performance for both green tea and black tea (F1-score > 0.92), even based on the indices of fresh tea leaves. Our study explores the potential of artificial intelligence algorithm in classification and prediction of tea products with different sensory quality.

Title: Self-determined sequence exercise program for elderly with sarcopenia: A Randomized controlled trial with clinical assistance from explainable artificial intelligence.
Year: 2023
Authors: He Shichun, Wei Meiqi, Meng Deyu, Wang Ziyi, Yang Guang, Wang Ziheng
Abstract: To improve and even reverse sarcopenia in elderly people, this study developed a self-determined sequence exercise program consisting of strength training exercise, Yijinjing exercise (a traditional Chinese exercise), and hybrid strength training with Yijinjing exercise. Ninety-four community-dwelling older adults screened for sarcopenia using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of a control group (CG, n = 30), self-determined sequence exercise program group (SDSG, n = 34) or strength training group (STG, n = 30). The study examined the effects of three interventions on participantsL3 skeletal muscle fat density, L3 skeletal muscle fat area, L3 skeletal muscle density, L3 skeletal muscle area, muscle fat infiltration, relative skeletal muscle mass index, and grip strength using a repeated-measures ANOVA to evaluate the experimental data. To evaluate the real effect of this model in reversing sarcopenia after the intervention, nine classification models were trained. Significant interaction effects were observed with grip strength, RSMI, L3 SMD, and L3 SMA. At the 24th week, participants' grip strength, L3 SMFA, L3 SMA, and RSMI were improved significantly in the SDSG and STG. The SDSG achieved significantly greater RSMI and grip strength than the STG and CG after the intervention. The self-determined sequence exercise program exhibited better performance than the single type of exercise modality in reversing sarcopenia and improving older adults' skeletal muscle area. Consequently, the stacking model is feasible to make a prediction as to whether or not sarcopenia may be reversed in older adults.

Title: Sampled-based adaptive event-triggered resilient control for multiagent systems with hybrid cyber-attacks.
Year: 2023
Authors: Tan Lihua, Wang Xin
Abstract: The multiagent systems have shared broad application in many practical systems including unmanned aircraft clusters, intelligent robots, and intelligent transportation. However, many unexpected cyber-attacks may disturb or disrupt the normal communication of the agents, thus reducing the interacting efficiency of multiagent systems. Ever since the cyber-attacks have been proposed, the resilient control problem for multiagent systems has been intensively explored in light of the communication network growth. However, most of the consequences only focused on denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or deception attacks independently. Distinguished from the existing resilient control mechanisms, the current investigation represents the first attempt at designing an adaptive resilient controller for multiagent systems according to the sampled-based adaptive event-triggered manner, where denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and deception attacks are both considered. First, the hybrid cyber-attacks model and its impact on the closed-loop system are addressed. And then, an adaptive event-triggered strategy is proposed to reduce network resource consumption and ease the communication burden, where the designed adaptive law can automatically adjust the triggering threshold. Finally, the consensus state of multiagent systems is capable of achieving via a series of reasonable control rules formulated through Lyapunov functional approach despite suffering hybrid cyber-attacks. And a simulation example is given to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Title: [Artificial neural networks as a psychiatric instrument].
Year: 2023
Authors: Mertens L, Vennekens J, Op de Beeck H, Yargholi E, Van den Stock J
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved enormously over the past decade and is increasingly being applied to a range of domains, including psychiatry. AI encompasses several modalities, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), referring to computer models partly based on the workings of the brain. ANNs have existed since the &rsquo;50s, but only became &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; since the 2010s. The fact that they are inspired by the workings of the brain raises the question of whether they can also be used to model the (dys)functioning of the brain. This question led to the advent of the research field &lsquo;computational psychiatry&rsquo;.

Title: Promoting fast MR imaging pipeline by full-stack AI.
Year: 2024
Authors: Wang Zhiwen, Li Bowen, Yu Hui, Zhang Zhongzhou, Ran Maosong, Xia Wenjun, Yang Ziyuan, Lu Jingfeng, Chen Hu, Zhou Jiliu, Shan Hongming, Zhang Yi
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging modality in clinics for medical disease diagnosis, staging, and follow-up. Deep learning has been extensively used to accelerate k-space data acquisition, enhance MR image reconstruction, and automate tissue segmentation. However, these three tasks are usually treated as independent tasks and optimized for evaluation by radiologists, thus ignoring the strong dependencies among them; this may be suboptimal for downstream intelligent processing. Here, we present a novel paradigm, full-stack learning (FSL), which can simultaneously solve these three tasks by considering the overall imaging process and leverage the strong dependence among them to further improve each task, significantly boosting the efficiency and efficacy of practical MRI workflows. Experimental results obtained on multiple open MR datasets validate the superiority of FSL over existing state-of-the-art methods on each task. FSL has great potential to optimize the practical workflow of MRI for medical diagnosis and radiotherapy.

Title: Terahertz tunable vanadium dioxide metasurface for dynamic illusion and cloaking.
Year: 2024
Authors: Wang Ling, Gao Feng, Teng Shuhua, Tan Zhiguo, Zhang Xing, Lou Jun
Abstract: Realizing camouflage by illusion and cloaking based on the metasurface has received widespread attention recently. However, existing metasurface-based illusion and cloaking devices are valid for the incident wave with a specific frequency, angle, or polarization, or exhibit a single function. Therefore, a terahertz tunable vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) metasurface carpet cloak is proposed for dynamic illusion and cloaking. Simulation results show that by controlling the state of the VO<sub>2</sub>, the metasurface carpet cloak can simultaneously achieve illusion and cloaking functions, working at 0.45 THz and 0.6 THz, and is effective for orthogonal circularly polarized waves with different incidence angles. That is the function, frequency, incident angle, and polarization of the metasurface carpet cloak are dynamically adjustable. Besides, the metasurface carpet cloak is robust to the incident angle and is capable of polarization angle stability. This work has potential value in the real-life application of metasurface-based illusion and cloaking devices.

Title: Cross-Attention for Improved Motion Correction in Brain PET.

Authors: Cai Zhuotong, Zeng Tianyi, Lieffrig Eléonore V, Zhang Jiazhen, Chen Fuyao, Toyonaga Takuya, You Chenyu, Xin Jingmin, Zheng Nanning, Lu Yihuan, Duncan James S, Onofrey John A
Abstract: Head movement during long scan sessions degrades the quality of reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET) and introduces artifacts, which limits clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent deep learning-based motion correction work utilized raw PET list-mode data and hardware motion tracking (HMT) to learn head motion in a supervised manner. However, motion prediction results were not robust to testing subjects outside the training data domain. In this paper, we integrate a cross-attention mechanism into the supervised deep learning network to improve motion correction across test subjects. Specifically, cross-attention learns the spatial correspondence between the reference images and moving images to explicitly focus the model on the most correlative inherent information - the head region the motion correction. We validate our approach on brain PET data from two different scanners: HRRT without time of flight (ToF) and mCT with ToF. Compared with traditional and deep learning benchmarks, our network improved the performance of motion correction by 58% and 26% in translation and rotation, respectively, in multi-subject testing in HRRT studies. In mCT studies, our approach improved performance by 66% and 64% for translation and rotation, respectively. Our results demonstrate that cross-attention has the potential to improve the quality of brain PET image reconstruction without the dependence on HMT. All code will be released on GitHub: https://github.com/OnofreyLab/dl_hmc_attention_mlcn2023.

Authors: Sakai Daiki, Maeda Tadao, Ozaki Atsuta, Kanda Genki N, Kurimoto Yasuo, Takahashi Masayo
Abstract: We investigated the potential of ChatGPT in the ophthalmological field in the Japanese language using board examinations for specialists in the Japanese Ophthalmology Society. We tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4-based ChatGPT on five sets of past board examination problems in July 2023. Japanese text was used as the prompt adopting two strategies: zero- and few-shot prompting. We compared the correct answer rate of ChatGPT with that of actual examinees, and the performance characteristics in 10 subspecialties were assessed. ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 correctly answered 112 (22.4%) and 229 (45.8%) out of 500 questions with simple zero-shot prompting, respectively, and ChatGPT-4 correctly answered 231 (46.2%) questions with few-shot prompting. The correct answer rates of ChatGPT-3.5 were approximately two to three times lower than those of the actual examinees for each examination set (p = 0.001). However, the correct answer rates for ChatGPT-4 were close to approximately 70% of those of the examinees. ChatGPT-4 had the highest correct answer rate (71.4% with zero-shot prompting and 61.9% with few-shot prompting) in "blepharoplasty, orbit, and ocular oncology," and the lowest answer rate (30.0% with zero-shot prompting and 23.3% with few-shot prompting) in "pediatric ophthalmology." We concluded that ChatGPT could be one of the advanced technologies for practical tools in Japanese ophthalmology.

Title: Liver volumetric and anatomic assessment in living donor liver transplantation: The role of modern imaging and artificial intelligence.
Year: 2023
Authors: Machry Mayara, Ferreira Luis Fernando, Lucchese Angelica Maria, Kalil Antonio Nocchi, Feier Flavia Heinz
Abstract: The shortage of deceased donor organs has prompted the development of alternative liver grafts for transplantation. Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a viable option, expanding the donor pool and enabling timely transplantation with favorable graft function and improved long-term outcomes. An accurate evaluation of the donor liver's volumetry (LV) and anatomical study is crucial to ensure adequate future liver remnant, graft volume and precise liver resection. Thus, ensuring donor safety and an appropriate graft-to-recipient weight ratio. Manual LV (MLV) using computed tomography has traditionally been considered the gold standard for assessing liver volume. However, the method has been limited by cost, subjectivity, and variability. Automated LV techniques employing advanced segmentation algorithms offer improved reproducibility, reduced variability, and enhanced efficiency compared to manual measurements. However, the accuracy of automated LV requires further investigation. The study provides a comprehensive review of traditional and emerging LV methods, including semi-automated image processing, automated LV techniques, and machine learning-based approaches. Additionally, the study discusses the respective strengths and weaknesses of each of the aforementioned techniques. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, is expected to become a routine part of surgical planning in the near future. The implementation of AI is expected to enable faster and more accurate image study interpretations, improve workflow efficiency, and enhance the safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of the procedures. Accurate preoperative assessment of the liver plays a crucial role in ensuring safe donor selection and improved outcomes in LDLT. MLV has inherent limitations that have led to the adoption of semi-automated and automated software solutions. Moreover, AI has tremendous potential for LV and segmentation; however, its widespread use is hindered by cost and availability. Therefore, the integration of multiple specialties is necessary to embrace technology and explore its possibilities, ranging from patient counseling to intraoperative decision-making through automation and AI.

Title: Implementation of artificial intelligence models in magnetic resonance imaging with focus on diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis: narrative review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Nicoara Andreea-Iulia, Sas Lorena-Mihaela, Bita Cristina Elena, Dinescu Stefan Cristian, Vreju Florentin Ananu
Abstract: Early diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is essential to initiate timely interventions, such as medication and lifestyle changes, preventing irreversible joint damage, reducing symptoms, and improving long-term outcomes for patients. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist and hand, in case of RA and MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) in case of axSpA can identify inflammation before it is clinically discernible, this modality may be crucial for early diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, together with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have quickly evolved in the medical field, having an important role in improving diagnosis, prognosis, in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and monitoring the activity of rheumatic diseases through MRI. The improvements of AI techniques in the last years regarding imaging interpretation have demonstrated that a computer-based analysis can equal and even exceed the human eye. The studies in the field of AI have investigated how specific algorithms could distinguish between tissues, diagnose rheumatic pathology and grade different signs of early inflammation, all of them being crucial for tracking disease activity. The aim of this paper is to highlight the implementation of AI models in MRI with focus on diagnosis of RA and axSpA through a literature review.

Title: Visual analysis of commognitive conflict in collaborative problem solving in classrooms.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lu Jijian, Zhang Yuwei, Li Yangjie
Abstract: In today's knowledge-intensive and digital society, collaborative problem-solving (CPS) is considered a critical skill for students to develop. Moreover, international education research has embraced a new paradigm of communication-focused inquiry, and the commognitive theory helps enhance the understanding of CPS work. This paper aims to enhance the CPS skills by identifying, diagnosing, and visualizing commognitive conflicts during the CPS process, thereby fostering a learning-oriented innovative approach and even giving the script of technology-assisted feedback practices. Specifically, we utilized open-ended mathematical tasks and multi-camera video recordings to analyze the commognitive conflicts in CPS among 32 pairs, comprising 64 Year 7 students. After selecting the high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality student pairs based on the SOLO theory, further investigations were made in the discourse diagnosis and visual analysis for the knowledge dimensions of commognitive conflict. Finally, it was discovered that there is a need to encourage students to focus on and resolve commognitive conflicts while providing timely feedback. Visual studies of commognitive conflict can empower AI-assisted teaching, and the intelligent diagnosis and visual analysis of CPS provide innovative solutions for teaching feedback.

Title: Vascularization ability of glioma stem cells in different three-dimensional microenvironments.
Year: 2024
Authors: Wang Xuanzhi, Xu Tao, Niu Chaoshi
Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most common and aggressive adult central nervous system tumors. One prominent characteristic of GBM is the presence of abnormal microvessels. A significant correlation between angiogenesis and prognosis has been observed. Accurately reconstructing this neovascularization and tumor microenvironment through personalized <i>in vitro</i> disease models presents a significant challenge. However, it is crucial to develop new anti-angiogenic therapies for GBM. In this study, 3D bioprinted glioma stem cell (GSC)-laden hydrogel scaffolds, hybrid GSC hydrogels and cell-free hydrogel scaffolds were manufactured to investigate the vascularization ability of GSCs in varying 3D microenvironments. Our results demonstrated that the bioactivity of GSCs in the 3D bioprinted GSC-laden hydrogel scaffold was preferable and stable, and the amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor A and basic fibroblast growth factor were the highest in the microenvironment. When the three different models were co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the expression of angiogenesis-related markers was the most abundant in the bioprinted GSC-laden hydrogel scaffold. Additionally, xenograft tumors formed by bioprinted GSC-laden hydrogel scaffolds more closely resembled human gliomas regarding color, texture and vascularization. Notably, in xenograft tumors derived from 3D bioprinted GSC-laden hydrogel scaffolds, the number of human CD105<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly higher, and human endothelial vascular lumen-like structures were observed. This indicates that the 3D bioprinted GSC-laden hydrogel scaffold is a suitable model for mimicking the glioma microenvironment and studying tumor angiogenesis.

Title: Influence of substrate temperature on the properties of ZnTe:Cu films prepared by a magnetron co-sputtering method.
Year: 2024
Authors: Li Hongwei, Huang Haofei, Lina Azhati, Tang Ke, Chen Zhuorui, Zhang Zilong, Xu Ke, Ding Keke, Wang Linjun, Huang Jian
Abstract: Copper-doped Zinc Tellurium (ZnTe:Cu) films were deposited on borosilicate glass using magnetron co-sputtering technique. The influence of the substrate temperature on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of ZnTe:Cu films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer and Hall effect measurement system. The results indicate that substrate temperature significantly affects the properties of the ZnTe:Cu films. When the substrate temperature increases from room temperature to 600 °C, the (111)-preferred orientation of ZnTe:Cu films is gradually replaced by the (220)-preferred orientation. At high substrate temperatures (≥500 °C), the Cu<sub>x</sub>Te phase appears in the ZnTe:Cu films, resulting in higher carrier concentration (>10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>) and lower resistivity (<10<sup>-2</sup> Ω cm) of the prepared films.

Title: Where can offenders be found when they are not committing crimes? A cross-sectional survey of British police officers on non-crime locations.
Year: 2024
Authors: Denley John, Ariel Barak, Felson Marcus
Abstract: To date, the bulk of research on place and crime has concentrated on crime scene locations and home addresses of both victims and perpetrators. Beyond these locations, less is known about where offenders can be found during regular, non-criminal activity. These 'non-crime locations' provide information about offenders' lifestyles, their relationships with co-offenders, their preferred spots, and the places beyond the spatiotemporal boundaries of the crime where they may plan, manage, or deal with the aftermath of their behaviour. Yet there is a lack of systematic evidence, with the available research relying on local ethnographic designs, small samples or both, as access to such data was limited. This study utilises a novel approach by relying on the professional experience of intelligence police officers assigned to deal with serious and organised crime in the West Midlands County of the United Kingdom to determine the whereabouts of three types of non-crime locations: (a) hangout spots, (b) recruitment spots and (c) contraband hideout spots. Results suggest that offenders frequently visit gyms, specific restaurants, or private residences (not unlike locations where normative people hang out), and new members can be recruited anywhere. Drugs and firearms are strategically hidden near vulnerable persons. According to police officers, offenders are unconcerned by surveillance in these spots and choose venues not usually owned by criminal groups. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed.

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is one of the main pathogens causing severe respiratory infections in children, as a common cause of immunodeficiency-related deaths in children and elderly individuals, the prevalence of HMPV has been showing an increasing trend during the last years. However, no vaccines or effective treatment plans are available currently. In this present, based on candidate proteins highly associated with viral virulence and has promising protective potential, we screened for immunodominant cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, and Linear B-cell epitopes from the most promising candidate Fusion protein, together with G, SH, M, and M2. All epitopes were predicted to have strong antigenicity by Vaxijen and pose no potential toxicity, allergenicity, or hormonology to human proteins by Toxinpred, Allerpred, and Blast analysis, meanwhile, high conservancy is demanded to cover different subtypes. adjuvants β-defensin II and Pam2Cys was attached with EAAAK linkers to improve vaccine's efficiency. Then, calculation of physicochemical properties proved the protein vaccine as a product can stably exist in the human body. Besides, we assessed the docking between the vaccine and immune receptors to evaluate its ability to stimulate immune responses, and the dynamic simulation further confirmed that the vaccine can tightly bind with immune receptors, which approved that the construction has the potential to induce strong humoral and cellular immune response. Finally, the vaccine was constructed into a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine, the immune simulations suggest that this is a vaccine candidate for controlling HMPV infection.

Title: Three-dimensional, dual-color nanoscopy enabled by migrating photon avalanches with one single low-power CW beam.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhu Zhimin, Liang Yusen, Zhao Qi, Wu Hui, Pan Binxiong, Qiao Shuqian, Wang Baoju, Zhan Qiuqiang
Abstract: The development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is very essential for understanding the physical and biological fundamentals at nanometer scale. However, to date most super-resolution modalities require either complicated/costly purpose-built systems such as multiple-beam architectures or complex post-processing procedures with intrinsic artifacts. Achieving three-dimensional (3D) or multi-channel sub-diffraction microscopic imaging using a simple method remains a challenging and struggling task. Herein, we proposed 3D highly-nonlinear super-resolution microscopy using a single-beam excitation strategy, and the microscopy principle was modelled and studied based on the ultrahigh nonlinearity enabled by photon avalanches. According to the simulation, the point spread function of highly nonlinear microscopy is switchable among different modes and can shrink three-dimensionally to sub-diffraction scale at the photon avalanche mode. Experimentally, we demonstrated 3D optical nanoscopy assisted with huge optical nonlinearities in a simple laser scanning configuration, achieving a lateral resolution down to 58 nm (λ/14) and an axial resolution down to 185 nm (λ/5) with one single beam of low-power, continuous-wave, near-infrared laser. We further extended the photon avalanche effect to many other emitters to develop multi-color photon avalanching nanoprobes based on migrating photon avalanche mechanism, which enables us to implement single-beam dual-color sub-diffraction super-resolution microscopic imaging.

Abstract: Protein loops play a critical role in the dynamics of proteins and are essential for numerous biological functions, and various computational approaches to loop modeling have been proposed over the past decades. However, a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method is lacking. In this work, we constructed two high-quality datasets (i.e. the General dataset and the CASP dataset) and systematically evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of 13 commonly used loop modeling approaches from the perspective of loop lengths, protein classes and residue types. The results indicate that the knowledge-based method FREAD generally outperforms the other tested programs in most cases, but encountered challenges when predicting loops longer than 15 and 30 residues on the CASP and General datasets, respectively. The ab initio method Rosetta NGK demonstrated exceptional modeling accuracy for short loops with four to eight residues and achieved the highest success rate on the CASP dataset. The well-known AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold require more resources for better performance, but they exhibit promise for predicting loops longer than 16 and 30 residues in the CASP and General datasets. These observations can provide valuable insights for selecting suitable methods for specific loop modeling tasks and contribute to future advancements in the field.

Title: Joint deep autoencoder and subgraph augmentation for inferring microbial responses to drugs.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhou Zhecheng, Zhuo Linlin, Fu Xiangzheng, Zou Quan
Abstract: Exploring microbial stress responses to drugs is crucial for the advancement of new therapeutic methods. While current artificial intelligence methodologies have expedited our understanding of potential microbial responses to drugs, the models are constrained by the imprecise representation of microbes and drugs. To this end, we combine deep autoencoder and subgraph augmentation technology for the first time to propose a model called JDASA-MRD, which can identify the potential indistinguishable responses of microbes to drugs. In the JDASA-MRD model, we begin by feeding the established similarity matrices of microbe and drug into the deep autoencoder, enabling to extract robust initial features of both microbes and drugs. Subsequently, we employ the MinHash and HyperLogLog algorithms to account intersections and cardinality data between microbe and drug subgraphs, thus deeply extracting the multi-hop neighborhood information of nodes. Finally, by integrating the initial node features with subgraph topological information, we leverage graph neural network technology to predict the microbes' responses to drugs, offering a more effective solution to the 'over-smoothing' challenge. Comparative analyses on multiple public datasets confirm that the JDASA-MRD model's performance surpasses that of current state-of-the-art models. This research aims to offer a more profound insight into the adaptability of microbes to drugs and to furnish pivotal guidance for drug treatment strategies. Our data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/ZZCrazy00/JDASA-MRD.

Title: Multifunctioning of carboxylic-cellulose nanocrystals on the reinforcement of compressive strength and conductivity for acrylic-based hydrogel.
Year: 2024
Authors: Luo Jintang, Song Tao, Han Tingting, Qi Haisong, Liu Qunhua, Wang Qiang, Song Zhongqian, Rojas Orlando
Abstract: Simultaneously having competitive compressive properties, fatigue-resistant stability, excellent conductivity and sensitivity has still remained a challenge for acrylic-based conductive hydrogels, which is critical in their use in the sensor areas where pressure is performed. In this work, an integrated strategy was proposed for preparing a conductive hydrogel based on acrylic acid (AA) and sodium alginate (SA) by addition of carboxylic-cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-COOH) followed by metal ion interaction to reinforce its compressive strength and conductivity simultaneously. The CNC-COOH played a multifunctional role in the hydrogel by well-dispersing SA and AA in the hydrogel precursor solution for forming a uniform semi-interpenetrating network, providing more hydrogen bonds with SA and AA, more -COOH for metal ion interactions to form uniform multi-network, and also offering high modulus to the final hydrogel. Accordingly, the as-prepared hydrogels showed simultaneous excellent compressive strength (up to 3.02 MPa at a strain of 70 %) and electrical conductivity (6.25 S m<sup>-1</sup>), good compressive fatigue-resistant (93.2 % strength retention after 1000 compressive cycles under 50 % strain) and high sensitivity (gauge factor up to 14.75). The hydrogel strain sensor designed in this work is capable of detecting human body movement of pressing, stretching and bending with highly sensitive conductive signals, which endows it great potential for multi-scenario strain sensing applications.

Title: Recent advances of chitosan as a hemostatic material: Hemostatic mechanism, material design and prospective application.
Year: 2024
Authors: Zhang Shuxiang, Lei Xiuxue, Lv Yongle, Wang Lei, Wang Lu-Ning
Abstract: Uncontrolled hemorrhage arising from surgery or trauma may cause morbidity and even mortality. Therefore, facilitating control of severe bleeding is imperative for health care worldwide. Among diverse hemostatic materials, chitosan (CS) is becoming the most promising material owing to its non-toxic feature, as well as inherently hemostatic performance. However, further enhancing hemostatic property of CS-based materials without compromising more beneficial functions remains a challenge. In this review, representative hemostatic mechanisms of CS-based materials are firstly discussed in detail, mostly including red blood cells (RBCs) aggregation, platelet adherence and aggregation, as well as interaction with plasma proteins. Also, various forms (involving powder/particle, sponge, hydrogel, nanofiber, and other forms) of CS-based hemostatic materials are systematically summarized, mainly focusing on their design and preparation, characteristics, and comparative analysis of various forms. In addition, varied hemostatic applications are described in detail, such as skin wound hemostasis, liver hemostasis, artery hemostasis, and heart hemostasis. Finally, current challenges and future directions of functional design of CS-based hemostatic materials in diverse hemostatic applications are proposed to inspire more intensive researches.

Year: 2024
Authors: Gong Linshan, Zhu Juncheng, Yang Yuxin, Qiao Shihao, Ma Liang, Wang Hongxia, Zhang Yuhao
Abstract: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a flexible, water-soluble, non-immunogenic, as well as biocompatible polymer, and it could synergize with polysaccharides for food applications. The molecular modification strategies, including covalent bond interactions (amino groups, carboxyl groups, aldehyde groups, tosylate groups, etc.), and non-covalent bond interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, etc.) on PEG molecular chains are discussed. Its versatile structure, group modifiability, and amphiphilic block buildability could improve the functions of polysaccharides (e.g., chitosan, cellulose, starch, alginate, etc.) and adjust the properties of combined PEG/polysaccharides with outstanding chain tunability and matrix processability owing to plasticizing effects, compatibilizing effects, steric stabilizing effects and excluded volume effects by PEG, for achieving the diverse performance targets. The synergetic properties of PEG/polysaccharides with remarkable architecture were summarized, including mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, antioxidant performance, self-healing properties, carrier and delivery characteristics. The PEG/polysaccharides with excellent combined properties and embeddable merits illustrate potential applications including food packaging, food intelligent indication/detection, food 3D printing and nutraceutical food absorption. Additionally, prospects (like food innovation and preferable nutrient utilization) and key challenges (like structure-effectiveness-applicability relationship) for PEG/polysaccharides are proposed and addressed for food fields.

Title: Designing and preparing supramolecular encapsulation systems based on fraxetin and cyclodextrins for highly selective detection of nicotine.
Year: 2024
Authors: Yang Yun-Han, Zhang Zhen, Bao Qiu-Lian, Zhao Fang, Yang Ming-Kun, Tao Xin, Chen Yan, Zhang Jun-Tong, Yang Li-Juan
Abstract: Herein, a series of water-soluble supramolecular inclusion complexes (ICs) probes were prepared using cyclodextrins (CDs) and fraxetin (FRA) to detect nicotine (NT) with high selectivity in vitro and in vivo. The FRA/CD ICs prepared through the saturated solution method exhibited excellent water solubility, stability, and biocompatibility. A clear host-guest inclusion model was provided by the theoretical calculations. The investigation revealed that NT was able to enter into the cavities of FRA/β-CD IC and FRA/γ-CD IC, and further formed charge transfer complexes with FRA in the CD cavities, resulting in a rapid and highly selective fluorescence-enhanced response with the lowest detection limits of 1.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M and 9.7 × 10<sup>-7</sup> M, and the linear response ranged from 0.02 to 0.3 mM and 0.01-0.05 mM, respectively. The IC probes showed good anti-interference performance to common interferents or different pH environments, with satisfactory reproducibility and repeatability of response to NT. Furthermore, the potentiality of the probes was confirmed through fluorescence imaging experiments using human lung cancer cells and the lung tissue of mice. This study offers a fresh perspective for detecting NT in environmental and biomedical analysis.

Title: Data pyramid structure for optimizing EUS-based GISTs diagnosis in multi-center analysis with missing label.
Year: 2023
Authors: Fan Lin, Gong Xun, Zheng Cenyang, Li Jiao
Abstract: This study introduces the Data Pyramid Structure (DPS) to address data sparsity and missing labels in medical image analysis. The DPS optimizes multi-task learning and enables sustainable expansion of multi-center data analysis. Specifically, It facilitates attribute prediction and malignant tumor diagnosis tasks by implementing a segmentation and aggregation strategy on data with absent attribute labels. To leverage multi-center data, we propose the Unified Ensemble Learning Framework (UELF) and the Unified Federated Learning Framework (UFLF), which incorporate strategies for data transfer and incremental learning in scenarios with missing labels. The proposed method was evaluated on a challenging EUS patient dataset from five centers, achieving promising diagnostic performance. The average accuracy was 0.984 with an AUC of 0.927 for multi-center analysis, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. The interpretability of the predictions further highlights the potential clinical relevance of our method.

Title: CDRIME-MTIS: An enhanced rime optimization-driven multi-threshold segmentation for COVID-19 X-ray images.
Year: 2023
Authors: Li Yupeng, Zhao Dong, Ma Chao, Escorcia-Gutierrez José, Aljehane Nojood O, Ye Xia
Abstract: To improve the detection of COVID-19, this paper researches and proposes an effective swarm intelligence algorithm-driven multi-threshold image segmentation (MTIS) method. First, this paper proposes a novel RIME structure integrating the Co-adaptive hunting and dispersed foraging strategies, called CDRIME. Specifically, the Co-adaptive hunting strategy works in coordination with the basic search rules of RIME at the individual level, which not only facilitates the algorithm to explore the global optimal solution but also enriches the population diversity to a certain extent. The dispersed foraging strategy further enriches the population diversity to help the algorithm break the limitation of local search and thus obtain better convergence. Then, on this basis, a new multi-threshold image segmentation method is proposed by combining the 2D non-local histogram with 2D Kapur entropy, called CDRIME-MTIS. Finally, the results of experiments based on IEEE CEC2017, IEEE CEC2019, and IEEE CEC2022 demonstrate that CDRIME has superior performance than some other basic, advanced, and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of global search, convergence performance, and escape from local optimality. Meanwhile, the segmentation experiments on COVID-19 X-ray images demonstrate that CDRIME is more advantageous than RIME and other peers in terms of segmentation effect and adaptability to different threshold levels. In conclusion, the proposed CDRIME significantly enhances the global optimization performance and image segmentation of RIME and has great potential to improve COVID-19 diagnosis.

Title: Changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drive a succession of toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis blooms.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiang Jingyu, Zeng Jiaying, Wang Jingkai, Zuo Jun, Wei Nian, Song Lirong, Shan Kun, Gan Nanqin
Abstract: The dynamic changes between toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis blooms have always been a hot topic. Previous studies have found that low CO<sub>2</sub> favors toxic strains, but how changing dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (CO<sub>2</sub> [aq]) in water body influences the succession of toxic and non-toxic strains in Microcystis blooms remains uncertain. Here, we combined laboratory competition experiments, field observations, and a machine learning model to reveal the links between CO<sub>2</sub> changes and the succession. Laboratory experiments showed that under low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (100-150 ppm), the toxic strains could make better use of CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) and be dominant. The non-toxic strains demonstrated a growth advantage as CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased (400-1000 ppm). Field observations from June to November in Lake Taihu showed that the percentage of toxic strains increased as CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) decreased. Machine learning highlighted links between the inorganic carbon concentration and the proportion of advantageous strains. Our findings provide new insights for cyanoHABs prediction and prevention.

Abstract: The increasing use of insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) produces a high rate of false positive (FP) diagnoses. Their verification results in a high workload for caregivers. We evaluated the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ILR-ECG Analyzer™ (ILR-ECG-A). This machine-learning algorithm reclassifies ICM-transmitted events to minimize the rate of FP diagnoses, while preserving device sensitivity.

Abstract: Ieramilimab, a humanized anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody, was well tolerated in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody spartalizumab in a phase 1 study. This phase 2 study aimed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of combination treatment in patients with selected advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) solid malignancies. Eligible patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), mesothelioma, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were grouped depending on prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy (anti-PD-1/L1 naive or anti-PD-1/L1 pretreated). Patients received ieramilimab (400 mg) followed by spartalizumab (300 mg) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), along with safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker assessments. Of 235 patients, 142 were naive to anti-PD-1/L1 and 93 were pretreated with anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies. Durable responses (>24 months) were seen across all indications for patients naive to anti-PD-1/L1 and in melanoma and RCC patients pretreated with anti-PD1/L1. The most frequent study drug-related AEs were pruritus (15.5%), fatigue (10.6%), and rash (10.6%) in patients naive to anti-PD-1/L1 and fatigue (18.3%), rash (14.0%), and nausea (10.8%) in anti-PD-1/L1 pretreated patients. Biomarker assessment indicated higher expression of T-cell-inflamed gene signature at baseline among responding patients. Response to treatment was durable (>24 months) in some patients across all enrolled indications, and safety findings were in accordance with previous and current studies exploring LAG-3/PD-1 blockade.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-Based Diagnostic Support System for Functional Dyspepsia Based on Brain Activity and Food Preference.
Year: 2023
Authors: Katsumata Ryo, Hosokawa Takayuki, Kamada Tomoari
Abstract: Background and aim Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are disorders where no organic clinical abnormalities are detected such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The brain activity of individuals with FD and IBS differs from that of healthy controls. Artificial intelligence can distinguish healthy controls from individuals with DGBI using several biomarkers. This study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support system using food preferences and brain activity in patients with DGBI. Methods ROME IV criteria were used to diagnose patients with FD and IBS. Their food preference was scored using a visual analog scale, and brain activity in the prefrontal cortex was investigated using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The diagnostic model was developed based on the brain activity and visual analog scale scores for food using an artificial neural network model. Results Forty-one participants, including 25 patients with DGBI were enrolled in the study. The accuracy of the artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using an artificial neural network in differentiating between healthy controls and patients with DGBI and between healthy controls and those with FD were 72.3% and 77.1%, respectively. Conclusions The artificial intelligence-based diagnostic model using brain activity and preference to food images showed sufficiently high accuracy in distinguishing patients with DGBI from healthy controls, and those with FD from healthy controls. Therefore, the fNIRS system provides objective evidence for diagnosing DGBI.

Title: Asymptotic Properties of Neural Network Sieve Estimators.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shen Xiaoxi, Jiang Chang, Sakhanenko Lyudamila, Lu Qing
Abstract: Neural networks have become one of the most popularly used methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Due to the universal approximation theorem (Hornik et al., 1989), a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on compact support as long as the number of hidden units is sufficiently large. Statistically, a neural network can be classified into a nonlinear regression framework. However, if we consider it parametrically, due to the unidentifiability of the parameters, it is difficult to derive its asymptotic properties. Instead, we consider the estimation problem in a nonparametric regression framework and use the results from sieve estimation to establish the consistency, the rates of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the neural network estimators. We also illustrate the validity of the theories via simulations.

Title: Secure and privacy-preserving automated machine learning operations into end-to-end integrated IoT-edge-artificial intelligence-blockchain monitoring system for diabetes mellitus prediction.
Year: 2024
Authors: Hennebelle Alain, Ismail Leila, Materwala Huned, Al Kaabi Juma, Ranjan Priya, Janardhanan Rajiv
Abstract: Diabetes Mellitus, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has no cure to date and can lead to severe health complications, such as retinopathy, limb amputation, cardiovascular diseases, and neuronal disease, if left untreated. Consequently, it becomes crucial to be able to monitor and predict the incidence of diabetes. Machine learning approaches have been proposed and evaluated in the literature for diabetes prediction. This paper proposes an IoT-edge-Artificial Intelligence (AI)-blockchain system for diabetes prediction based on risk factors. The proposed system is underpinned by blockchain to obtain a cohesive view of the risk factors data from patients across different hospitals and ensure security and privacy of the user's data. We provide a comparative analysis of different medical sensors, devices, and methods to measure and collect the risk factors values in the system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out within our proposed system, using the most accurate random forest (RF) model, and the two most used state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using three real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that the proposed system predicts diabetes using RF with 4.57% more accuracy on average in comparison with the other models LR and SVM, with 2.87 times more execution time. Data balancing without feature selection does not show significant improvement. When using feature selection, the performance is improved by 1.14% for PIMA Indian and 0.02% for Sylhet datasets, while it is reduced by 0.89% for MIMIC III.

Title: Intelligent prediction modeling for flexural capacity of FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete beams using machine learning algorithms.
Year: 2024
Authors: Khan Majid, Khan Adil, Khan Asad Ullah, Shakeel Muhammad, Khan Khalid, Alabduljabbar Hisham, Najeh Taoufik, Gamil Yaser
Abstract: Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) are widely utilized to improve the efficiency and durability of concrete structures, either through external bonding or internal reinforcement. However, the response of FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) members, both in field applications and experimental settings, often deviates from the estimation based on existing code provisions. This discrepancy can be attributed to the limitations of code provisions in fully capturing the nature of FRP-strengthened RC members. Accordingly, machine learning methods, including gene expression programming (GEP) and multi-expression programming (MEP), were utilized in this study to predict the flexural capacity of the FRP-strengthened RC beam. To develop data-driven estimation models, an extensive collection of experimental data on FRP-strengthened RC beams was compiled from the experimental studies. For the assessment of the accuracy of developed models, various statistical indicators were utilized. The machine learning (ML) based models were compared with empirical and conventional linear regression models to substantiate their superiority, providing evidence of enhanced performance. The GEP model demonstrated outstanding predictive performance with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.98 for both the training and validation phases, accompanied by minimal mean absolute errors (MAE) of 4.08 and 5.39, respectively. In contrast, the MEP model achieved a slightly lower accuracy, with an R of 0.96 in both the training and validation phases. Moreover, the ML-based models exhibited notably superior performances compared to the empirical models. Hence, the ML-based models presented in this study demonstrated promising prospects for practical implementation in engineering applications. Moreover, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method was used to interpret the feature's importance and influence on the flexural capacity. It was observed that beam width, section effective depth, and the tensile longitudinal bars reinforcement ratio significantly contribute to the prediction of the flexural capacity of the FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete beam.

Title: Evaluation of physical education teaching effect using Random Forest model under artificial intelligence.
Year: 2024
Authors: Jiang Xiaowei, Du Yuwei, Zheng Yingying
Abstract: This work aims to optimize the physical education (PE) teaching effect based on deep learning (DL) to cultivate high-level college students better. Firstly, the present situation of college teachers' teaching ability is surveyed to realize the deficiencies in teaching. Secondly, an optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the node splitting mode. This algorithm can solve the problem of single and similar node splitting modes in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The independent node splitting method Iterative Dichotomiser 3 and Classification and Regression Tree in the algorithm are recombined, and new splitting rules are obtained through adaptive parameter selection. Finally, the scheme designed is tested. The results suggest: The results suggest: (1) During the training of the proposed algorithm, although the loss curve at 4550 and 6800 points has a small crest, the error of the network loss function shows a downward trend and tends to be flat; (2) Compared with unoptimized Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Genetic Algorithm-Back Propagation (GA-BP), the proposed algorithm shows better performance both in terms of time consumption and accuracy (time consumption is less than 5.4 ms, and accuracy is more than 95 %). In a word, using the GA-BP-RF algorithm proposed to improve the PE teaching effect is feasible. The proposed model provides ideas for applying DL technology to improve teachers' teaching abilities.

Title: Method of interacting between humans and conversational voice agent systems.
Year: 2024
Authors: Park Daehee, Kim Euisik
Abstract: Voice agent systems are deployed widely in various devices such as mobile phones, smart speakers, televisions, and refrigerators. Although the market for voice agent systems has expanded significantly and the systems themselves are becoming intelligent, their usability remains limited. This study provides general and practical guidelines for voice interaction to help VUI (Voice User Interface) designers and developers in the process of designing voice agent systems. The current guidelines only offer generic information for VUI designers, as they only provide the static aspect of voice interaction rather than consider the entire conversation flow. Studies on designing voice interaction systems have shown that VUI designers and developers need more guidance. The new interaction guidelines were developed based on users' cognitive strategy in the course of using voice agent systems. We proposed and evaluated 12 practical voice interaction design guidelines for conversational voice agent systems. To evaluate the guidelines, we recruited 60 experts with different levels of voice interaction. Participants evaluated the usefulness of the guidelines and provided insightful opinions on them.

Title: Quantum technology for development framework as a tool for science diplomacy.
Year: 2023
Authors: Mafu Mhlambululi, Senekane Makhamisa
Abstract: The state-of-the-art quantum technologies leverage the unique principles of quantum mechanics, which include quantization, uncertainty principle, interference, entanglement and decoherence, to produce useful devices and scientific advancements not possible with classical technologies. As a result, quantum technologies, in particular, offer specific advantages that make communications networks secure and unbreakable and devices with unprecedented levels of accuracy, responsiveness, reliability, scalability and efficiency than classical emerging technologies. These capabilities can contribute significantly to addressing energy, agriculture, climate change, national security, healthcare, education and economic growth challenges. Unfortunately, these developments in these areas have not been evenly distributed between the Global North and the Global South, inadvertently creating a societal and economic gap. Closing this gap is critical to creating a more inclusive and sustainable future for all, thus delivering key sustainable goals. Therefore, to close this gap, this article proposes a quantum diplomacy framework as a means to deliver science diplomacy. Moreover, we discuss how emerging quantum technologies could profoundly impact all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We consider this work a timely and vital intervention to prevent the gap from increasing.

Title: PE-Net: a parallel framework for 3D inferior mesenteric artery segmentation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Kun, Xu Peixia, Wang Meirong, Lin Pengcheng, Crookes Danny, He Bosheng, Hua Liang
Abstract: The structural morphology of mesenteric artery vessels is of significant importance for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, developing automated vessel segmentation methods for this purpose remains challenging. Existing convolution-based segmentation methods have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformer-based models require large datasets, making them less suitable for tasks with limited training samples. Moreover, over-segmentation, mis-segmentation, and vessel discontinuity are common challenges in vessel segmentation tasks. To address these issues, we propose a parallel encoding architecture that combines transformers and convolutions to retain the advantages of both approaches. The model effectively learns position deviations and enhances robustness for small-scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce a vessel edge capture module to improve vessel continuity and topology. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of our model, with Dice Similarity Coefficient and Average Hausdorff Distance scores of 81.64% and 7.7428, respectively.

Title: Epigenetic regulation and therapeutic strategies in ulcerative colitis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yan Liwei, Gu Chao, Gao Shanyu, Wei Benzheng
Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease, and is characterized by the diffuse inflammation and ulceration in the colon and rectum mucosa, even extending to the caecum. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylations, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, are implicated in the differentiation, maturation, and functional modulation of multiple immune and non-immune cell types, and are influenced and altered in various chronic inflammatory diseases, including UC. Here we review the relevant studies revealing the differential epigenetic features in UC, and summarize the current knowledge about the immunopathogenesis of UC through epigenetic regulation and inflammatory signaling networks, regarding DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNAs and lncRNAs. We also discuss the epigenetic-associated therapeutic strategies for the alleviation and treatment of UC, which will provide insights to intervene in the immunopathological process of UC in view of epigenetic regulation.

Title: Enhancing knowledge discovery from unstructured data using a deep learning approach to support subsurface modeling predictions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Hoover Brendan, Zaengle Dakota, Mark-Moser MacKenzie, Wingo Patrick, Suhag Anuj, Rose Kelly
Abstract: Subsurface interpretations and models rely on knowledge from subject matter experts who utilize unstructured information from images, maps, cross sections, and other products to provide context to measured data (e. g., cores, well logs, seismic surveys). To enhance such knowledge discovery, we advanced the National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL) Subsurface Trend Analysis (STA) workflow with an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning approach for image embedding. NETL's STA method offers a validated science-based approach of combining geologic systems knowledge, statistical modeling, and datasets to improve predictions of subsurface properties. The STA image embedding tool quickly extracts images from unstructured knowledge products like publications, maps, websites, and presentations; categorically labels the images; and creates a repository for geologic domain postulation. Via a case study on geographic and subsurface literature of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), results show the STA image embedding tool extracts images and correctly labels them with ~90 to ~95% accuracy.

Authors: Zhuo Linsheng, Guo Mengqin, Zhang Siyi, Wu Junbo, Wang Mingshu, Shen Yang, Peng Xue, Wang Zhen, Jiang Weifan, Huang Wei
Abstract: The role of AXL in various oncogenic processes has made it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Currently, kinase selectivity profiles, especially circumventing MET inhibition, remain a scientific issue of great interest in the discovery of selective type II AXL inhibitors. Starting from a dual MET/AXL-targeted lead structure from our previous work, we optimized a 1,6-naphthyridinone series using molecular modeling-assisted compound design to improve AXL potency and selectivity over MET, resulting in the potent and selective type II AXL-targeted compound 25c. This showed excellent AXL inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.1 nM) and 343-fold selectivity over the highly homologous kinase MET in biochemical assays. Moreover, compound 25c significantly inhibited AXL-driven cell proliferation, dose-dependently suppressed 4T1 cell migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis. Compound 25c also showed noticeable antitumor efficacy in a BaF3/TEL-AXL xenograft model at well-tolerated doses. Overall, this study presented a potent and selective type II AXL-targeted lead compound for further drug discovery.

Title: SilenceREIN: seeking silencers on anchors of chromatin loops by deep graph neural networks.
Year: 2023
Authors: Pan Jian-Hua, Du Pu-Feng
Abstract: Silencers are repressive cis-regulatory elements that play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Experimental methods for identifying silencers are always costly and time-consuming. Computational methods, which relies on genomic sequence features, have been introduced as alternative approaches. However, silencers do not have significant epigenomic signature. Therefore, we explore a new way to computationally identify silencers, by incorporating chromatin structural information. We propose the SilenceREIN method, which focuses on finding silencers on anchors of chromatin loops. By using graph neural networks, we extracted chromatin structural information from a regulatory element interaction network. SilenceREIN integrated the chromatin structural information with linear genomic signatures to find silencers. The predictive performance of SilenceREIN is comparable or better than other states-of-the-art methods. We performed a genome-wide scanning to systematically find silencers in human genome. Results suggest that silencers are widespread on anchors of chromatin loops. In addition, enrichment analysis of transcription factor binding motif support our prediction results. As far as we can tell, this is the first attempt to incorporate chromatin structural information in finding silencers. All datasets and source codes of SilenceREIN have been deposited in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/JianHPan/SilenceREIN).

Title: Self-supervised artificial intelligence predicts recurrence, metastasis and disease specific death from primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at diagnosis.
Year: 2023

Abstract: Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is responsible for ~10,000 deaths annually in the United States. Stratification of risk of poor outcome (PO) including recurrence, metastasis and disease specific death (DSD) at initial biopsy would significantly impact clinical decision-making during the initial post operative period where intervention has been shown to be most effective. In this multi-institutional study, we developed a state-of-the-art self-supervised deep-learning approach with interpretability power and demonstrated its ability to predict poor outcomes of cSCCs at the time of initial biopsy. By highlighting histomorphological phenotypes, our approach demonstrates that poor differentiation and deep invasion correlate with poor prognosis. Our approach is particularly efficient at defining poor outcome risk in Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) T2a and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T2 cSCCs. This bridges a significant gap in our ability to assess risk among T2a/T2 cSCCs and may be useful in defining patients at highest risk of poor outcome at the time of diagnosis. Early identification of highest-risk patients could signal implementation of more stringent surveillance, rigorous diagnostic work up and identify patients who might best respond to early postoperative adjunctive treatment.

Title: Artificial intelligence-based morphometric signature to identify ductal carcinoma in situ with low risk of progression to invasive breast cancer.
Year: 2023

Abstract: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may progress to ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (iIBC), but often never will. Because DCIS is treated as early breast cancer, many women with harmless DCIS face overtreatment. To identify these women that may forego treatment, we hypothesized that DCIS morphometric features relate to the risk of subsequent iIBC. We developed an artificial intelligence-based DCIS morphometric analysis pipeline (AIDmap) to detect DCIS as a pathologist and measure morphological structures in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. These were from a case-control study of patients diagnosed with primary DCIS, treated by breast-conserving surgery without radiotherapy. We analyzed 689 WSIs of DCIS of which 226 were diagnosed with subsequent iIBC (cases) and 463 were not (controls). The distribution of 15 duct morphological measurements in each H&E was summarized in 55 morphometric variables. A ridge regression classifier with cross validation predicted 5-years-free of iIBC with an area-under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.76). A morphometric signature based on the 30 variables most associated with outcome, identified lesions containing small-sized ducts, low number of cells and low DCIS/stroma area ratio. This signature was associated with lower iIBC risk in a multivariate regression model including grade, ER, HER2 and COX-2 expression (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-0.78). AIDmap has potential to identify harmless DCIS that may not need treatment.

Abstract: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them, typically during periods of rest. The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS are incompletely understood. Here, we present a whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (n = 9,851) and controls (n = 38,957) in three population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE). Genome-wide association analysis identified nine independent risk loci, of which eight had been previously reported, and one was a novel risk locus (<i>LMX1B</i>, rs35196838, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-1.19, <i>p</i>-value = 2.2 × 10<sup>-9</sup>). A genome-wide, gene-based common variant analysis identified <i>GLO1</i> as an additional risk gene (<i>p</i>-value = 8.45 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study also identified <i>GLO1</i> and a previously unreported gene, <i>ELFN1</i>. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.40, se = 0.08, <i>p</i>-value = 5.4 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), depression (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.35, se = 0.06, <i>p</i>-value = 2.17 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), and intelligence (r<sub>g</sub> = -0.20, se = 0.06, <i>p-</i>value = 4.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Our study expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS and highlights the contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder.

Title: RxBERT: Enhancing drug labeling text mining and analysis with AI language modeling.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wu Leihong, Gray Magnus, Dang Oanh, Xu Joshua, Fang Hong, Tong Weida
Abstract: The US drug labeling document contains essential information on drug efficacy and safety, making it a crucial regulatory resource for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug reviewers. Due to its extensive volume and the presence of free-text, conventional text mining analysis have encountered challenges in processing these data. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for natural language processing (NLP) have provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify key information from drug labeling, thereby enhancing safety reviews and support for regulatory decisions. We developed RxBERT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model pretrained on FDA human prescription drug labeling documents for an enhanced application of drug labeling documents in both research and drug review. RxBERT was derived from BioBERT with further training on human prescription drug labeling documents. RxBERT was demonstrated in several tasks using regulatory datasets, including those involved in the National Institutes of Technology Text Analysis Challenge Dataset (NIST TAC dataset), the FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Dataset (ADE Eval dataset), and the classification of texts from submission packages into labeling sections (US Drug Labeling dataset). For all these tasks, RxBERT reached 86.5 <i>F</i>1-scores in both TAC and ADE Eval classification, respectively, and prediction accuracy of 87% for the US Drug Labeling dataset. Overall, RxBERT was shown to be as competitive or have better performance compared to other NLP approaches such as BERT, BioBERT, etc. In summary, we developed RxBERT, a transformer-based model specific for drug labeling that outperformed the original BERT model. RxBERT has the potential to be used to assist research scientists and FDA reviewers to better process and utilize drug labeling information toward the advancement of drug effectiveness and safety for public health. This proof-of-concept study also demonstrated a potential pathway to customized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the sensitive regulatory documents for internal application.

Authors: Dundas James, Leipsic Jonathon A, Sellers Stephanie, Blanke Philipp, Miranda Patricia, Ng Nicholas, Mullen Sarah, Meier David, Akodad Mariama, Sathananthan Janarthanan, Collet Carlos, de Bruyne Bernard, Muller Olivier, Tzimas Georgios
Abstract: Purpose To evaluate the performance of a new artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool by comparing the quantified stenosis severity at coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with a reference standard derived from invasive quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Materials and Methods This secondary, post hoc analysis included 120 participants (mean age, 59.7 years ± 10.8 [SD]; 73 [60.8%] men, 47 [39.2%] women) from three large clinical trials (AFFECTS, P3, REFINE) who underwent CCTA and invasive coronary angiography with QCA. Quantitative analysis of coronary stenosis severity at CCTA was performed using an AI-based coronary stenosis quantification (AI-CSQ) software service. Blinded comparison between QCA and AI-CSQ was measured on a per-vessel and per-patient basis. Results The per-vessel AI-CSQ diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80%, 88%, 86%, 65%, and 94%, respectively, for diameter stenosis (DS) 50% or greater; and 78%, 92%, 91%, 47%, and 98%, respectively, for DS 70% or greater. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) to predict DS of 50% or greater and 70% or greater on a per-vessel basis were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.95; <i>P</i> < .001) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.97; <i>P</i> < .001), respectively.

Title: Demystifying AI: Current State and Future Role in Medical Education Assessment.
Year: 2023
Authors: Turner Laurah, Hashimoto Daniel A, Vasisht Shubha, Schaye Verity
Abstract: Medical education assessment faces multifaceted challenges, including data complexity, resource constraints, bias, feedback translation, and educational continuity. Traditional approaches often fail to adequately address these issues, creating stressful and inequitable learning environments. This article introduces the concept of precision education, a data-driven paradigm aimed at personalizing the educational experience for each learner. It explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its subsets Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), can augment this model to tackle the inherent limitations of traditional assessment methods.AI can enable proactive data collection, offering consistent and objective assessments while reducing resource burdens. It has the potential to revolutionize not only competency assessment but also participatory interventions, such as personalized coaching and predictive analytics for at-risk trainees. The article also discusses key challenges and ethical considerations in integrating AI into medical education, such as algorithmic transparency, data privacy, and the potential for bias propagation.AI's capacity to process large datasets and identify patterns allows for a more nuanced, individualized approach to medical education. It offers promising avenues to not only improve the efficiency of educational assessments but also to make them more equitable. However, the ethical and technical challenges must be diligently addressed. The article concludes that embracing AI in medical education assessment is a strategic move toward creating a more personalized, effective, and fair educational landscape. This necessitates collaborative, multidisciplinary research and ethical vigilance to ensure that the technology serves educational goals while upholding social justice and ethical integrity.

Title: Exploring the role of AI in classifying, analyzing, and generating case reports on assisted suicide cases: feasibility and ethical implications.
Year: 2023
Authors: Spitale Giovanni, Schneider Gerold, Germani Federico, Biller-Andorno Nikola
Abstract: This paper presents a study on the use of AI models for the classification of case reports on assisted suicide procedures. The database of the five Dutch regional bioethics committees was scraped to collect the 72 case reports available in English. We trained several AI models for classification according to the categories defined by the Dutch Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act. We also conducted a related project to fine-tune an OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo large language model for generating new fictional but plausible cases. As AI is increasingly being used for judgement, it is possible to imagine an application in decision-making regarding assisted suicide. Here we explore two arising questions: feasibility and ethics, with the aim of contributing to a critical assessment of the potential role of AI in decision-making in highly sensitive areas.

Title: The forgotten method? Pulsed electric field thresholds from the perspective of texture analysis.
Year: 2024
Authors: Genovese Jessica, Rocculi Pietro, Miklavčič Damijan, Mahnič-Kalamiza Samo
Abstract: Pulsed electric field (PEF) technology has found applications in various industrial food sectors, including the potato industry, winemaking, biorefinery, and juice extraction, among others. The practical implementation of PEF technology in the food industry is however still hindered by several challenges. The detection and quantification of PEF effects are complex due to the variable characteristics and properties of raw materials, including cellular composition, structural organization, textural properties, and tissue porosity. Moreover, the PEF treatment parameters (e.g., pulse amplitude, duration, shape, rate), and process parameters (e.g., temperature, pH, medium conductivity) further complicate the optimization of PEF protocols, requiring a case-by-case approach. Knowledge of treated material properties and their functional dependence on PEF is a crucial prerequisite to informed, intelligent design of treatment protocols. We present an experimental study designed to gain insights into the mechanism behind the changes in textural properties induced by PEF in both plant and animal tissues. These changes in texture are then compared with findings from our previous study on electrical impedance, to highlight how different methods of detection of PEF-induced changes in tissue can yield vastly different results based on the method of analysis used depending on tissue properties. Furthermore, texture analysis unveiled the less-explored effects of PEF treatment on electroosmosis phenomena in both plant and animal tissues. We provide a comparative analysis between plant and animal tissues to elucidate the differences in deformation resulting from PEF treatment. We thus demonstrate how important it is, be it in the development phase or for process control during industrial operation, to choose an appropriate method of characterising PEF-induced changes in tissue to avoid under- or overtreatment.

Title: Potential of Lactobacillus plantarum A56 in relieving food allergy through immunoregulation, antioxidation and reshaping intestinal microbiota.
Year: 2023
Authors: Duan Cuicui, Ma Lin, Qin Mengchun, Zhang Lingfang, Hu Shunan, Liu Lifan, Sun Yixue, Ma Fumin, Li Dan
Abstract: Food allergy is an abnormal immune reaction triggered by food protein antigens. Relevant studies have suggested that probiotic supplementation was with the potential to alleviate food allergy. This study aimed to explore the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum A56 on the alleviation of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced food allergy via immunomodulatory function, antioxidation and modification of intestinal microbiota. Balb/c mice were sensitized with OVA (20μg/mouse) by intraperitoneal injection for three weeks and accompanied by oral administration of L. plantarum A56 (10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL), subsequently with orally challenged twice by OVA at 50 mg/mL for one week. The results showed that oral supplementation of L. plantarum A56 could effectively relieve allergic symptoms of mice, and decreased OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 concentrations. It also declined interleukin (IL)-4 level, raised interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in serum and splenocyte supernatant, and the qPCR results were consistent with above results. Moreover, L. plantarum A56 treatment also fortified superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels, and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level in serum. The increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and forkhead box O1 (Foxo1) expression indicated that L. plantarum A56 exerted antioxidation through Nrf2-Foxo1 pathway. In addition, L. plantarum A56 treatment elevated Bacteroidetes richness, ASV/OTU number, species diversity, etc. Notably, Spearman correlation analysis indicated that Bacteroidetes displayed obviously negative correlation with IgE and IgG1, but Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria exhibited significantly positive correlation with IgG1 and IgE. Collectively, these results suggested that L. plantarum A56 could alleviate OVA-induced food allergy by regulating Th1/Th2 imbalance, anti-oxidation and modulating intestinal microbiota.

Title: Exploration of a novel electrochemical CN coupling process: Urea synthesis from direct air carbon capture with nitrate wastewater.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chen Ying, Liu Yuan, Hu Shujie, Wu Di, Zhang Mengyue, Cheng Zhiliang
Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) can be used to decrease the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere, but this requires substantial energy consumption. If residual waste carbon (in the form of bicarbonate solution) from DAC can be directly reused, it might present a novel method for overcoming the aforementioned challenges. Electrochemical CN coupling methods for synthesizing urea have garnered considerable attention for waste carbon utilization, but the carbon source is high-purity CO<sub>2</sub>. No research has been conducted regarding the application of bicarbonate solution as the carbon source. This study proposes a proof-of-concept electrochemical CN coupling process for synthesizing urea using bicarbonate solution from DAC as the carbon source and nitrate from wastewater as the nitrogen source. These results confirmed the feasibility of synthesizing urea using a three-electrode system employing TF and CuInS<sub>2</sub>/TF as the working electrodes via potentiostatic electrolysis. Under the optimal conditions (initial pH 5.0 and applied potential of -1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl), the urea yield after 2 h of electrolysis reached 3017.2 μg h<sup>-1</sup> mg<sub>cat.</sub><sup>-1</sup> and an average Faradaic efficiency of 19.6 %. The in-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy indicated a gradual increase in the intensity of the -CONH bond signal on the surface of the CuInS<sub>2</sub>/TF electrode as the reaction progressed. This implied that this bond may be a key chemical group in this process. The density functional theory calculations demonstrated that *CONH was a pivotal intermediate during CN coupling, and a two-step CN coupling reaction path was proposed. *NH + *CO primarily transformed into *CONH, followed by the conversion reaction of *CONH + *NO to *NOCONH<sub>2</sub>. This study offers a groundbreaking approach for waste carbon utilization from DAC and holds the potential to furnish technical underpinnings for advancing electrochemical CN coupling methods.

Title: Design strategies for enhancing antitumor efficacy through tumor microenvironment exploitation using albumin-based nanosystems: A review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Cai, Yang Kai, Yang Guangbao
Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic system that plays a crucial role in regulating cancer progression, treatment response, and the emergence of acquired resistance mechanisms. The TME is usually featured by severe hypoxia, low pH values, high hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, and overproduction of glutathione (GSH). The current development of intelligent nanosystems that respond to TME has shown great potential to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment. As one of the functional macromolecules explored in this field, albumin-based nanocarriers, known for their inherent biocompatibility, serves as a cornerstone for constructing diverse therapeutic platforms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the design strategies of albumin nanosystems, aiming to enhance cancer therapy by harnessing various features of solid tumors, including tumor hypoxia, acidic pH, the condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) network, excessive GSH, high glucose levels, and tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, we highlight representative designs of albumin-based nanoplatforms by exploiting the TME that enhance a broad range of cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and other tumor therapies. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges and future prospects in direction of albumin-based nanosystems for the practical applications in advancing enhanced cancer treatments.

Title: Enhancing microalgal biomass production in lab-scale raceway ponds through innovative computational fluid dynamics-based electrode deflectors.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shao Cong, Zheng Hongjing, Sobhi Mostafa, Zhu Feifei, Hu Xinjuan, Cui Yi, Chen Huayou, Zou Bin, Zan Xinyi, Li Gang, Huo Shuhao
Abstract: The design of novel electrode deflector structures (EDSs) introduced a promising strategy for enhancing raceway ponds performance, increasing carbon fixation, and improving microalgal biomass accumulation. The computational fluid dynamics, based flow field principles, proved that the potency of arc-shaped electrode deflector structures (A-EDS) and spiral electrode deflector structures (S-EDS) were optimal. These configurations yielded superior culture effects, notably reducing dead zones by 9.1% and 11.7%, while elevating biomass increments of 14.7% and 11.5% compared to the control, respectively. In comparison to scenarios without electrostatic field application, the A-EDS group demonstrated pronounced post-stimulation growth, exhibiting an additional biomass increase of 11.2%, coupled with a remarkable 23.6% surge in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate and mixing time reduction by 14.7%. A-EDS and S-EDS, combined with strategic electric field integration, provided a theoretical basis for promoting microalgal biomass production and enhancing carbon fixation in a raceway pond environment to similar production practices.

Title: Continuous real-time assessment of acute cognitive stress from cardiac mechanical signals captured by a skin-like patch.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zavanelli Nathan, Lee Sung Hoon, Guess Matthew, Yeo Woon-Hong
Abstract: The inability to objectively quantify cognitive stress in real-time with wearable devices is a crucial unsolved problem with serious negative consequences for dementia and mental disability patients and those seeking to improve their quality of life. Here, we introduce a skin-like, wireless sternal patch that captures changes in cardiac mechanics due to stress manifesting in the seismocardiogram (SCG) signals. Judicious optimization of the device's micro-structured interconnections and elastomer integration yields a device that sufficiently matches the skin's mechanics, robustly yet gently adheres to the skin without aggressive tapes, and captures planar and longitudinal SCG waves well. The device transmits SCG beats in real-time to a user's device, where derived features relate to the heartbeat's mechanical morphology. The signals are assessed by a series of features in a support vector machine regressor. Controlled studies, compared to gold standard cortisol and following the validated imaging test, show an R-squared correlation of 0.79 between the stress prediction and cortisol change, significantly improving over prior works. Likewise, the system demonstrates excellent robustness to external temperature and physical recovery status while showing excellent accuracy and wearability in full-day use.

Title: Artificial Intelligence-based System for Detecting Attention Levels in Students.
Year: 2023
Authors: Marquez-Carpintero Luis, Pina-Navarro Monica, Suescun-Ferrandiz Sergio, Escalona Felix, Gomez-Donoso Francisco, Roig-Vila Rosabel, Cazorla Miguel
Abstract: The attention level of students in a classroom can be improved through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. By automatically identifying the attention level, teachers can employ strategies to regain students' focus. This can be achieved through various sources of information. One source is to analyze the emotions reflected on students' faces. AI can detect emotions, such as neutral, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, happiness, and anger. Additionally, the direction of the students' gaze can also potentially indicate their level of attention. Another source is to observe the students' body posture. By using cameras and deep learning techniques, posture can be analyzed to determine the level of attention. For example, students who are slouching or resting their heads on their desks may have a lower level of attention. Smartwatches distributed to the students can provide biometric and other data, including heart rate and inertial measurements, which can also be used as indicators of attention. By combining these sources of information, an AI system can be trained to identify the level of attention in the classroom. However, integrating the different types of data poses a challenge that requires creating a labeled dataset. Expert input and existing studies are consulted for accurate labeling. In this paper, we propose the integration of such measurements and the creation of a dataset and a potential attention classifier. To provide feedback to the teacher, we explore various methods, such as smartwatches or direct computers. Once the teacher becomes aware of attention issues, they can adjust their teaching approach to re-engage and motivate the students. In summary, AI techniques can automatically identify the students' attention level by analyzing their emotions, gaze direction, body posture, and biometric data. This information can assist teachers in optimizing the teaching-learning process.

Title: ASMF: Ambient social media forensics chain of custody with an intelligent digital investigation process using federated learning.
Year: 2024
Authors: Khan Abdullah Ayub, Zhang Xuzhuo, Hajjej Fahima, Yang Jing, Ku Chin Soon, Por Lip Yee
Abstract: Ambient Intelligence is a concept that relates to a new paradigm of pervasive computing and has the objective of automating responses from the system to humans without any human intervention. In social media forensics, gathering, analyzing, storing, and validating relevant evidence for investigation in a heterogeneous environment is still questionable. There is no hierarchy for automation, even though standardization and secure processes from data collection to validation have not yet been discussed. This poses serious issues for the current investigation procedures and future evidence chain of custody management. This paper contributes threefold. First, it proposes a framework using a blockchain network with a dual chain of data transmission for privacy protection, such as on-chain and off-chain. Second, a protocol is designed to detect and separate local and global cyber threats and undermine multiple federated principles to personalize search space broadly. Third, this study manages personalized updates by means of optimizing backtracking parameters and automating replacements, which directly affects the reduction of negative influence on the social networking environment in terms of imbalanced and distributed data issues. This proposed framework enhances stability in digital investigation. In addition, the simulation uses an extensive social media dataset in different cyberspaces with a variety of cyber threats to investigate. The proposed work outperformed as compared to traditional single-level personalized search and other state-of-the-art schemes.

Title: Predicting anti-TNF treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis: An artificial intelligence-driven model using cytokine profile and routine clinical practice parameters.
Year: 2024
Authors: Valdivieso Shephard Juan Luis, Alvarez Robles Enrique Josue, Cámara Hijón Carmen, Hernandez Breijo Borja, Novella-Navarro Marta, Bogas Schay Patricia, Cuesta de la Cámara Ricardo, Balsa Criado Alejandro, López Granados Eduardo, Plasencia Rodríguez Chamaida
Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous disease in which therapeutic strategies used have evolved dramatically. Despite significant progress in treatment strategies such as the development of anti-TNF drugs, it is still not possible to differentiate those patients who will respond from who will not. This can lead to effective-treatment delays and unnecessary costs. The aim of this study was to utilize a profile of the patient's characteristics, clinical parameters, immune status (cytokine profile) and artificial intelligence to assess the feasibility of developing a tool that could allow us to predict which patients will respond to treatment with anti-TNF drugs.

Title: A diachronic study determining syntactic and semantic features of Urdu-English neural machine translation.
Year: 2024
Authors: Shah Tamkeen Zehra, Imran Muhammad, Ismail Sayed M
Abstract: Machine translation produces marginal accuracy rates for low-resource languages, but its deep learning model expects to yield improved accuracy with time. This longitudinal study investigates how Google Translate's Urdu-to-English translated output has evolved between 2018 and 2021. Accuracy and acceptability of the translations have been determined by, a) an interlinear gloss that identifies core semantic units and grammatical functions to be translated and, b) a descriptive comparison of the translated text's syntactic and semantic properties with those of the source text. Overall, despite a 50 % error rate that persists over the three-year interval, the research reports significant improvement in the overall intelligibility of the translations, in contrast to initial results from 2018, which exhibited rampant non-localized errors. Working backwards from instances of errors to morphosyntactic and semantic patterns underlying them, the study concludes that the pro-drop feature of Urdu, Urdu's case-marking system, identification of clause boundaries, polysemous terms, and orthographically similar words pose the greatest difficulty in neural machine translation. These results point to the need for incorporating syntactic information in training data.

Title: Forest fire surveillance systems: A review of deep learning methods.
Year: 2024
Authors: Saleh Azlan, Zulkifley Mohd Asyraf, Harun Hazimah Haspi, Gaudreault Francis, Davison Ian, Spraggon Martin
Abstract: This review aims to critically examine the existing state-of-the-art forest fire detection systems that are based on deep learning methods. In general, forest fire incidences bring significant negative impact to the economy, environment, and society. One of the crucial mitigation actions that needs to be readied is an effective forest fire detection system that are able to automatically notify the relevant parties on the incidence of forest fire as early as possible. This review paper has examined in details 37 research articles that have implemented deep learning (DL) model for forest fire detection, which were published between January 2018 and 2023. In this paper, in depth analysis has been performed to identify the quantity and type of data that includes images and video datasets, as well as data augmentation methods and the deep model architecture. This paper is structured into five subsections, each of which focuses on a specific application of deep learning (DL) in the context of forest fire detection. These subsections include 1) classification, 2) detection, 3) detection and classification, 4) segmentation, and 5) segmentation and classification. To compare the model's performance, the methods were evaluated using comprehensive metrics like accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), F1-Score, mean pixel accuracy (MPA), etc. From the findings, of the usage of DL models for forest fire surveillance systems have yielded favourable outcomes, whereby the majority of studies managed to achieve accuracy rates that exceeds 90%. To further enhance the efficacy of these models, future research can explore the optimal fine-tuning of the hyper-parameters, integrate various satellite data, implement generative data augmentation techniques, and refine the DL model architecture. In conclusion, this paper highlights the potential of deep learning methods in enhancing forest fire detection that is crucial for forest fire management and mitigation.

Title: STGA-MS: AI diagnosis model of regional wall motion abnormality based on 2D transthoracic echocardiography.
Year: 2024
Authors: Sun Song, Wang Yonghuai, Yu Qi, Qu Mingjun, Li Honghe, Yang Jinzhu
Abstract: Regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) is a common manifestation of ischemic heart disease detected through echocardiography. Currently, RWMA diagnosis heavily relies on visual assessment by doctors, leading to limitations in experience-based dependence and suboptimal reproducibility among observers. Several RWMA diagnosis models were proposed, while RWMA diagnosis with more refined segments can provide more comprehensive wall motion information to better assist doctors in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. In this paper, we proposed the STGA-MS model which consists of three modules, the spatial-temporal grouping attention (STGA) module, the segment feature extraction module, and the multiscale downsampling module, for the diagnosis of RWMA for multiple myocardial segments. The STGA module captures global spatial and temporal information, enhancing the representation of myocardial motion characteristics. The segment feature extraction module focuses on specific segment regions, extracting relevant features. The multiscale downsampling module analyzes myocardial motion deformation across different receptive fields. Experimental results on a 2D transthoracic echocardiography dataset show that the proposed STGA-MS model achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. It holds promise in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of RWMA diagnosis, assisting clinicians in diagnosing ischemic heart disease more reliably.

Title: Ecology & computer audition: Applications of audio technology to monitor organisms and environment.
Year: 2024
Authors: Schuller Björn W, Akman Alican, Chang Yi, Coppock Harry, Gebhard Alexander, Kathan Alexander, Rituerto-González Esther, Triantafyllopoulos Andreas, Pokorny Florian B
Abstract: Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the 2030 Agenda and adopted by all the United Nations member states, the 13th SDG is a call for action to combat climate change. Moreover, SDGs 14 and 15 claim the protection and conservation of life below water and life on land, respectively. In this work, we provide a literature-founded overview of application areas, in which computer audition - a powerful but in this context so far hardly considered technology, combining audio signal processing and machine intelligence - is employed to monitor our ecosystem with the potential to identify ecologically critical processes or states. We distinguish between applications related to organisms, such as species richness analysis and plant health monitoring, and applications related to the environment, such as melting ice monitoring or wildfire detection. This work positions computer audition in relation to alternative approaches by discussing methodological strengths and limitations, as well as ethical aspects. We conclude with an urgent call to action to the research community for a greater involvement of audio intelligence methodology in future ecosystem monitoring approaches.

Authors: Rahman Muhammad Zia Ur, Akbar Muhammad Azeem, Leiva Víctor, Martin-Barreiro Carlos, Imran Muhammad, Riaz Muhammad Tanveer, Castro Cecilia
Abstract: In this study, an internet of things (IoT)-enabled fuzzy intelligent system is introduced for the remote monitoring, diagnosis, and prescription of treatment for patients with COVID-19. The main objective of the present study is to develop an integrated tool that combines IoT and fuzzy logic to provide timely healthcare and diagnosis within a smart framework. This system tracks patients' health by utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, a small and affordable computer that reads data from various sensors, to gather data. Once collected, the data are processed, analyzed, and transmitted to a web page for remote access via an IoT-compatible Wi-Fi module. In cases of emergencies, such as abnormal blood pressure, cardiac issues, glucose levels, or temperature, immediate action can be taken to monitor the health of critical COVID-19 patients in isolation. The system employs fuzzy logic to recommend medical treatments for patients. Sudden changes in these medical conditions are remotely reported through a web page to healthcare providers, relatives, or friends. This intelligent system assists healthcare professionals in making informed decisions based on the patient's condition.

Title: Progress and summary of reinforcement learning on energy management of MPS-EV.
Year: 2024
Authors: Lin Yang, Chu Liang, Hu Jincheng, Hou Zhuoran, Li Jihao, Jiang Jingjing, Zhang Yuanjian
Abstract: The escalating environmental concerns and energy crisis caused by internal combustion engines (ICE) have become unacceptable under environmental regulations and the energy crisis. As a promising alternative solution, multi-power source electric vehicles (MPS-EVs) integrate various clean energy systems to enhance the powertrain efficiency. The energy management strategy (EMS) is plays a pivotal role for MPS-EVs to maximize efficiency, fuel economy, and range. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an effective methodology for EMS development, attracting continuous attention and research. However, a systematic analysis of the design elements of RL-based EMS is currently lacking. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of current research on RL-based EMS (RL-EMS) and summarizing its design elements. This paper first summarizes the previous applications of RL in EMS from five aspects: algorithm, perception scheme, decision scheme, reward function, and innovative training method. It highlights the contributions of advanced algorithms to training effectiveness, provides a detailed analysis of perception and control schemes, classifies different reward function settings, and elucidates the roles of innovative training methods. Finally, by comparing the development routes of RL and RL-EMS, this paper identifies the gap between advanced RL solutions and existing RL-EMS. Potential development directions are suggested for implementing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in EMS.

Title: Cerium oxide nanoparticles modulating the Parkinson's disease conditions: From the alpha synuclein structural point of view and antioxidant properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles.
Year: 2024
Authors: Yao Xiaomei, Guan Yichao, Wang Jianli, Wang Dong
Abstract: Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of dementia, which is associated with the progressive deterioration of the intelligence and senses. Free radicals are created during oxidative stress in cells, which are considered one of the destructive factors in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the antifibrillar and antioxidant properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. The CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs were synthesized and analyzed to reveal the physicochemical and biological properties. The results showed that the CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs have unique properties with potent antioxidant activities. The experimental and computational studies showed that the CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs interact with the active site of Alpha-synuclein. The existence of hydrogen bonding between O atoms of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs and N-H of adjacent acid amines and the equilibrium distances were confirmed by 1.751 (Leu100), 1.786 (Gln99) and 2.213 Å (Lys97). The minimum free energy binding of L-DOPA drug (as positive control) and CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs were negative, resulting interaction between compounds and protein. As a result, these compounds inhibited Alpha-synuclein protein aggregation. In addition, that CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs strongly binds with receptor by relative binding energy as compared with L-DOPA drug. These findings revealed that CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs prevent Alpha-synuclein fibrillation and can be applied as nano-drug against the Parkinson's disease.

Title: An efficient model for predicting human diseases through miRNA based on multiple-types of contrastive learning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liao Qingquan, Fu Xiangzheng, Zhuo Linlin, Chen Hao
Abstract: Multiple studies have demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA) can be deeply involved in the regulatory mechanism of human microbiota, thereby inducing disease. Developing effective methods to infer potential associations between microRNAs (miRNAs) and diseases can aid early diagnosis and treatment. Recent methods utilize machine learning or deep learning to predict miRNA-disease associations (MDAs), achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, the problem of sparse neighborhoods of nodes due to lack of data has not been well solved. To this end, we propose a new model named MTCL-MDA, which integrates multiple-types of contrastive learning strategies into a graph collaborative filtering model to predict potential MDAs. The model adopts a contrastive learning strategy based on topology, which alleviates the damage to model performance caused by sparse neighborhoods. In addition, the model also adopts a semantic-based contrastive learning strategy, which not only reduces the impact of noise introduced by topology-based contrastive learning, but also enhances the semantic information of nodes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing models on all evaluation metrics. Case analysis shows that our model can more accurately identify potential MDA, which is of great significance for the screening and diagnosis of real-life diseases. Our data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Lqingquan/MTCL-MDA.

Title: A design space for automated material handling vehicles.
Year: 2023
Authors: Mirnig Alexander G, Fröhlich Peter, Zafari Setareh, Gafert Michael, Kröninger Lukas, Tscheligi Manfred
Abstract: Material Handling Vehicles (loaders, excavators, forklifts, harvesters, <i>etc.</i>) have seen a strong increase in automation efforts in recent years. The contexts such vehicles operate in are frequently complex and due to the often very specific nature of industrial material handling scenarios, know-how is fragmented and literature is not as numerous as, for example, for passenger vehicle automation. In this paper, we present a contextual design space for automated material handling vehicles (AMHV), that is intended to inform context analysis and design activities across a wide spectrum of material handling use cases. It was developed on the basis of existing context and design spaces for vehicle and machine automation and extended via expert knowledge. The design space consists of separate context and interaction subspaces, that separately capture the situation and each individual point of interaction, respectively. Implications, opportunities, and limitations for the investigation and design of AMHV are discussed.

Title: Beyond the Scalpel: Assessing ChatGPT's potential as an auxiliary intelligent virtual assistant in oral surgery.
Year: 2024
Authors: Suárez Ana, Jiménez Jaime, Llorente de Pedro María, Andreu-Vázquez Cristina, Díaz-Flores García Víctor, Gómez Sánchez Margarita, Freire Yolanda
Abstract: AI has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. Noteworthy advances in AI algorithms and large language models (LLM) have led to the development of natural generative language (NGL) systems such as ChatGPT. Although these LLM can simulate human conversations and generate content in real time, they face challenges related to the topicality and accuracy of the information they generate. This study aimed to assess whether ChatGPT-4 could provide accurate and reliable answers to general dentists in the field of oral surgery, and thus explore its potential as an intelligent virtual assistant in clinical decision making in oral surgery. Thirty questions related to oral surgery were posed to ChatGPT4, each question repeated 30 times. Subsequently, a total of 900 responses were obtained. Two surgeons graded the answers according to the guidelines of the Spanish Society of Oral Surgery, using a three-point Likert scale (correct, partially correct/incomplete, and incorrect). Disagreements were arbitrated by an experienced oral surgeon, who provided the final grade Accuracy was found to be 71.7%, and consistency of the experts' grading across iterations, ranged from moderate to almost perfect. ChatGPT-4, with its potential capabilities, will inevitably be integrated into dental disciplines, including oral surgery. In the future, it could be considered as an auxiliary intelligent virtual assistant, though it would never replace oral surgery experts. Proper training and verified information by experts will remain vital to the implementation of the technology. More comprehensive research is needed to ensure the safe and successful application of AI in oral surgery.

Title: Impaired cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy.
Year: 2024
Authors: Hsu Shao-Lun, Liao Yi-Chu, Wu Chia-Hung, Chang Feng-Chi, Chen Yung-Lin, Lai Kuan-Lin, Chung Chih-Ping, Chen Shih-Pin, Lee Yi-Chung
Abstract: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy, caused by cysteine-altering variants in <i>NOTCH3</i>, is the most prevalent inherited cerebral small vessel disease. Impaired cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics has been proposed as one of the potential culprits of neurodegeneration and may play a critical role in the initiation and progression of cerebral small vessel disease. In the present study, we aimed to explore the cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy and to evaluate its association with clinical features, imaging biomarkers and disease severity of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy. Eighty-one participants carrying a cysteine-altering variant in <i>NOTCH3</i>, including 44 symptomatic cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy patients and 37 preclinical carriers, and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy control individuals were recruited. All participants underwent brain MRI studies and neuropsychological evaluations. Cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics was investigated by using the non-invasive diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space method. We found that cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy patients exhibited significantly lower values of diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index comparing to preclinical carriers and healthy controls. For the 81 subjects carrying <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, older age and presence of hypertension were independently associated with decreased diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index. The degree of cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics was strongly related to the severity of cerebral small vessel disease imaging markers, with a positive correlation between diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index and brain parenchymal fraction and negative correlations between diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index and total volume of white matter hyperintensity, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity, lacune numbers and cerebral microbleed counts. In addition, diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index was a significant risk factor associated with the development of clinical symptoms of stroke or cognitive dysfunction in individuals carrying <i>NOTCH3</i> variants. In cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy patients, diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index was significantly associated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Mediation analysis showed that compromised cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics was not only directly associated with cognitive dysfunction but also had an indirect effect on cognition by influencing brain atrophy, white matter disruption, lacunar lesions and cerebral microbleeds. In conclusion, cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics is impaired in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy and its disruption may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space index may serve as a biomarker of disease severity for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy.

Title: Enhanced YOLOv7 integrated with small target enhancement for rapid detection of objects on water surfaces.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yu Jie, Zheng Hao, Xie Li, Zhang Lei, Yu Mei, Han Jin
Abstract: Unmanned surface vessel (USV) target detection algorithms often face challenges such as misdetection and omission of small targets due to significant variations in target scales and susceptibility to interference from complex environments. To address these issues, we propose a small target enhanced YOLOv7 (STE-YOLO) approach. Firstly, we introduce a specialized detection branch designed to identify tiny targets. This enhancement aims to improve the multi-scale target detection capabilities and address difficulties in recognizing targets of different sizes. Secondly, we present the lite visual center (LVC) module, which effectively fuses data from different levels to give more attention to small targets. Additionally, we integrate the lite efficient layer aggregation networks (L-ELAN) into the backbone network to reduce redundant computations and enhance computational efficiency. Lastly, we use Wise-IOU to optimize the loss function definition, thereby improving the model robustness by dynamically optimizing gradient contributions from samples of varying quality. We conducted experiments on the WSODD dataset and the FIOW-Img dataset. The results on the comprehensive WSODD dataset demonstrate that STE-YOLO, when compared to YOLOv7, reduces network parameters by 14% while improving AP50 and APs scores by 2.1% and 1.6%, respectively. Furthermore, when compared to five other leading target detection algorithms, STE-YOLO demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Detection of tactile-based error-related potentials (ErrPs) in human-robot interaction.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kim Su Kyoung, Kirchner Elsa Andrea
Abstract: Robot learning based on implicitly extracted error detections (e.g., EEG-based error detections) has been well-investigated in human-robot interaction (HRI). In particular, the use of error-related potential (ErrP) evoked when recognizing errors is advantageous for robot learning when evaluation criteria cannot be explicitly defined, e.g., due to the complex behavior of robots. In most studies, erroneous behavior of robots were recognized visually. In some studies, visuo-tactile stimuli were used to evoke ErrPs or a tactile cue was used to indicate upcoming errors. To our knowledge, there are no studies in which ErrPs are evoked when recognizing errors only via the tactile channel. Hence, we investigated ErrPs evoked by tactile recognition of errors during HRI. In our scenario, subjects recognized errors caused by incorrect behavior of an orthosis during the execution of arm movements tactilely. EEG data from eight subjects was recorded. Subjects were asked to give a motor response to ensure error detection. Latency between the occurrence of errors and the response to errors was expected to be short. We assumed that the motor related brain activity is timely correlated with the ErrP and might be used from the classifier. To better interpret and test our results, we therefore tested ErrP detections in two additional scenarios, i.e., without motor response and with delayed motor response. In addition, we transferred three scenarios (motor response, no motor response, delayed motor response). Response times to error was short. However, high ErrP-classification performance was found for all subjects in case of motor response and no motor response condition. Further, ErrP classification performance was reduced for the transfer between motor response and delayed motor response, but not for the transfer between motor response and no motor response. We have shown that tactilely induced errors can be detected with high accuracy from brain activity. Our preliminary results suggest that also in tactile ErrPs the brain response is clear enough such that motor response is not relevant for classification. However, in future work, we will more systematically investigate tactile-based ErrP classification.

Title: Multiple generation distinct toxicant exposures induce epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of enhanced pathology and obesity.
Year: 2023
Authors: Nilsson Eric E, McBirney Margaux, De Santos Sarah, King Stephanie E, Beck Daniel, Greeley Colin, Holder Lawrence B, Skinner Michael K
Abstract: Three successive multiple generations of rats were exposed to different toxicants and then bred to the transgenerational F5 generation to assess the impacts of multiple generation different exposures. The current study examines the actions of the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on the F0 generation, followed by jet fuel hydrocarbon mixture exposure of the F1 generation, and then pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane on the F2 generation gestating females. The subsequent F3 and F4 generations and F5 transgenerational generation were obtained and F1-F5 generations examined for male sperm epigenetic alterations and pathology in males and females. Significant impacts on the male sperm differential DNA methylation regions were observed. The F3-F5 generations were similar in ∼50% of the DNA methylation regions. The pathology of each generation was assessed in the testis, ovary, kidney, and prostate, as well as the presence of obesity and tumors. The pathology used a newly developed Deep Learning, artificial intelligence-based histopathology analysis. Observations demonstrated compounded disease impacts in obesity and metabolic parameters, but other pathologies plateaued with smaller increases at the F5 transgenerational generation. Observations demonstrate that multiple generational exposures, which occur in human populations, appear to increase epigenetic impacts and disease susceptibility.

Title: Conformal mirror descent with logarithmic divergences.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kainth Amanjit Singh, Wong Ting-Kam Leonard, Rudzicz Frank
Abstract: The logarithmic divergence is an extension of the Bregman divergence motivated by optimal transport and a generalized convex duality, and satisfies many remarkable properties. Using the geometry induced by the logarithmic divergence, we introduce a generalization of continuous time mirror descent that we term the conformal mirror descent. We derive its dynamics under a generalized mirror map, and show that it is a time change of a corresponding Hessian gradient flow. We also prove convergence results in continuous time. We apply the conformal mirror descent to online estimation of a generalized exponential family, and construct a family of gradient flows on the unit simplex via the Dirichlet optimal transport problem.

Title: ChatGPT 3.5 fails to write appropriate multiple choice practice exam questions.
Year: 2024
Authors: Ngo Alexander, Gupta Saumya, Perrine Oliver, Reddy Rithik, Ershadi Sherry, Remick Daniel
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) may have a profound impact on traditional teaching in academic settings. Multiple concerns have been raised, especially related to using ChatGPT for creating <i>de novo</i> essays. However, AI programs such as ChatGPT may augment teaching techniques. In this article, we used ChatGPT 3.5 to create 60 multiple choice questions. Author written text was uploaded and ChatGPT asked to create multiple choice questions with an explanation for the correct answer and explanations for the incorrect answers. Unfortunately, ChatGPT only generated correct questions and answers with explanations in 32 % of the questions (19 out of 60). In many instances, ChatGPT failed to provide an explanation for the incorrect answers. An additional 25 % of the questions had answers that were either wrong or misleading. A grade of 32 % would be considered failing in most courses. Despite these issues, instructors may still find ChatGPT useful for creating practice exams with explanations-with the caveat that extensive editing may be required.

Abstract: The skin is the largest organ and a crucial barrier for protection against various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. As we age, the skin's components become more vulnerable to damage, forming wrinkles. Among different procedures, hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel has been extensively utilized for skin regeneration and reducing wrinkles. However, it has limitations like low retention and weak mechanical properties. In this study, we suggested the poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) microparticles containing alkaline magnesium hydroxide and nitric oxide-generating zinc oxide and rejuvenative hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels including these functional microparticles and asiaticoside, creating a novel delivery system for skin rejuvenation and regeneration. The fabricated rejuvenative hydrogels have exhibited enhanced biocompatibility, pH neutralization, reactive oxygen species scavenging, collagen biosynthesis, and angiogenesis capabilities <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, an excellent volume retention ability was demonstrated due to the numerous hydrogen bonds that formed between hyaluronic acid and asiaticoside. Overall, our advanced injectable hydrogel containing functional microparticles, with controlled release of bioactive molecules, has a significant potential for enhancing the regeneration and rejuvenation of the skin.

Title: Embedding a multiple health condition approach across NHS Greater Manchester.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lake Claire, Mishra Aseem, Conroy Matthew
Abstract: Here, we present two real-world examples of how a prioritised, person-centred, multiple health condition approach - also termed a multimorbidity approach - has been applied to long-term condition management in general practice in Greater Manchester. The first example is the implementation of targeted multiple health condition reviews via a population health management approach across general practice in the City of Manchester. The second example is the development of a person-centred risk stratification tool, focused on unmet cardiovascular need, called 'CVNeed'. This tool provides a unique approach to highlighting the highest unmet need and, thus, the largest return on investment to the system from proactive efforts. These examples demonstrate how a person-centred, multiple health condition approach to long-term condition management, enabled by data intelligence to drive prioritisation of clinical need, can help to address longstanding health inequalities and unwarranted variation in health outcomes. This work also highlights the potential for integrated care systems (ICS) to work collaboratively to tackle health inequalities at a system, locality and neighbourhood level, thus making significant strides toward achieving the vision set out in the Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) Strategy.

Title: <i>JANUS</i>: an open-source 3D printable perfusion bioreactor and numerical model-based design strategy for tissue engineering.
Year: 2023
Authors: Meneses João, Fernandes Sofia R, Silva João C, Ferreira Frederico Castelo, Alves Nuno, Pascoal-Faria Paula
Abstract: Bioreactors have been employed in tissue engineering to sustain longer and larger cell cultures, managing nutrient transfer and waste removal. Multiple designs have been developed, integrating sensor and stimulation technologies to improve cellular responses, such as proliferation and differentiation. The variability in bioreactor design, stimulation protocols, and cell culture conditions hampered comparison and replicability, possibly hiding biological evidence. This work proposes an open-source 3D printable design for a perfusion bioreactor and a numerical model-driven protocol development strategy for improved cell culture control. This bioreactor can simultaneously deliver capacitive-coupled electric field and fluid-induced shear stress stimulation, both stimulation systems were validated experimentally and in agreement with numerical predictions. A preliminary <i>in vitro</i> validation confirmed the suitability of the developed bioreactor to sustain viable cell cultures. The outputs from this strategy, physical and virtual, are openly available and can be used to improve comparison, replicability, and control in tissue engineering applications.

Abstract: A ratiometric fluorescence sensor platform with easy-to-use and accurate is nanoengineered for NH<sub>3</sub> quantitative detection and visual real-time monitoring of chicken freshness using smartphones. The ratiometric fluorescent probe formed by combining the zinc ion complex and carbon dots has a double-emitted fluorescence peak. The fluorescence intensity of the complex changed can be clearly observed with the increase of the concentration of ammonia solution under 365 nm wavelength excitation. In order to detect NH<sub>3</sub> concentration in gaseous phase, a portable paper-based sensor was designed. The sensor had a good linear relationship with NH<sub>3</sub> concentration ranging from 10.0 to 90.0 μmol/L and the LOD value was 288 nM. This fluorescent paper-based sensor was used to check the freshness of chicken breast refrigerated at 4 °C, revealed observable shifts from blue to green. The fluorescent paper-based sensor can detect NH<sub>3</sub> concentration in real time and simplify the monitoring process of meat freshness while ensuring accuracy and stability.

Title: Compound weighted fusion evaluation and optimization of intelligent tracking algorithm in radar seeker.
Year: 2023
Authors: Hu Kaiyu, Yang Chunxia, Wang Zhaoyang, Wang Jiaming
Abstract: This paper designs a hierarchical weighted fusion evaluation/optimization scheme for the radar seeker neural network (NN) tracking algorithm. The first weighted fusion of closed-loop performance index is carried out to exclude the hardware influence on algorithm evaluation. Then, according to different tracking scenarios, the tracking index is divided into different periods; a single period score is given by a linear-nonlinear hybrid scoring mechanism. Furthermore, in a single index, the internal scores of different time periods are weighted and fused for the second time to obtain the index overall score. Finally, the third weighted fusion of the multi-index scores obtains the comprehensive score of the algorithm. We design the parameter evaluation case sets and repeat the aforementioned compound weighting; hence the case with the highest comprehensive score is obtained. Finally, the algorithm is optimized by the highest-score case. The experiment using fuzzy NN radar seeker verifies the effectiveness of the method.

Title: Gender Disparities in First Authorship in Publications Related to Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Year: 2023
Authors: Abraham Jeby, Panchal Kashyap, Varshney Leena, Lakshmi Narayan Kiran, Rahman Saman
Abstract: The medical profession has experienced a significant increase in the number of women practitioners in recent decades, leading to a reduction in the gender gap. According to the United States Medical Association, approximately 25% of physicians in the United States are now women. Although this progress is evident in the clinical setting, women's representation in academic medicine remains disproportionately low. The underrepresentation of women in academia has various consequences, including limited access to academic resources and hindered career growth. Previous studies have attempted to analyze these disparities, but results have been inconsistent, and the issue's complexity has not been fully understood. This study aims to examine the disparity in the gender of first authors in academic publications related to " Artificial intelligence (AI) and Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD)" between 2010 and 2023. Analysis was conducted on June 21st, 2023, using the database PubMed. The search term "AI" AND "ADHD" was used to derive all articles over a period of 13 years, from January 1st, 2010, to December 31st, 2022, excluding the year 2023 due to limited available publications. The relevant articles were downloaded in Microsoft Excel sheets. The gender of the first authors was determined using the NamSor app V.2, an application programming interface (API) with a large dataset of names and countries of origin. A total of 204 articles were considered for this study. There were 78 female first authors and 126 male first authors. The highest number of publications with a male first author occurred in 2022, with 32 publications. The Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, and China have the highest gender ratios, indicating a more favourable representation of both genders. The p-value of 0.2664 suggests that there is no significant association between gender and country. The findings revealed a gender disparity, with a higher number of male first authors. By addressing and rectifying these disparities, we can enhance the overall quality, diversity, and inclusivity of research in the field of ADHD and Artificial Intelligence.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a gradually maturing medical imaging technique that relies on computational algorithms for reconstructing and visualizing internal conductivity distributions within the human body. To provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the current state and trends in the EIT algorithm research, we conducted bibliometric analysis on a 25-year EIT algorithm research dataset sourced from Web of Science Core Collections. We visualized publication characteristics, collaboration patterns, keywords, and co-cited references. The results indicate a steady increase in annual publications over recent decades. The United States, United Kingdom, China, and South Korea contributed 60% of the articles collaboratively. Keyword analysis unveiled three distinct stages in the evolution of EIT algorithm research: the establishment of fundamental algorithm frameworks, optimization for improved imaging performance, and the development of algorithms for clinical applications. Additionally, there has been a shift in research focus from traditional theories to the incorporation of new methods, such as artificial intelligence. Co-cited references suggest that integrating EIT with other established imaging techniques may emerge as a new trend in EIT algorithm research. In summary, EIT algorithms have been a consistent research focus, with current efforts centered on optimizing algorithms to enhance imaging performance. The emerging research trend involves utilizing more diverse and intersecting algorithms.

Title: Liability for harm caused by AI in healthcare: an overview of the core legal concepts.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bottomley Dane, Thaldar Donrich
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare in Africa presents transformative opportunities but also raises profound legal challenges, especially concerning liability. As AI becomes more autonomous, determining who or what is responsible when things go wrong becomes ambiguous. This article aims to review the legal concepts relevant to the issue of liability for harm caused by AI in healthcare. While some suggest attributing legal personhood to AI as a potential solution, the feasibility of this remains controversial. The principal-agent relationship, where the physician is held responsible for AI decisions, risks reducing the adoption of AI tools due to potential liabilities. Similarly, using product law to establish liability is problematic because of the dynamic learning nature of AI, which deviates from static products. This fluidity complicates traditional definitions of product defects and, by extension, where responsibility lies. Exploring alternatives, risk-based determinations of liability, which focus on potential hazards rather than on specific fault assignments, emerges as a potential pathway. However, these, too, present challenges in assigning accountability. Strict liability has been proposed as another avenue. It can simplify the compensation process for victims by focusing on the harm rather than on the fault. Yet, concerns arise over the economic impact on stakeholders, the potential for unjust reputational damage, and the feasibility of a global application. Instead of approaches based on liability, reconciliation holds much promise to facilitate regulatory sandboxes. In conclusion, while the integration of AI systems into healthcare holds vast potential, it necessitates a re-evaluation of our legal frameworks. The central challenge is how to adapt traditional concepts of liability to the novel and unpredictable nature of AI-or to move away from liability towards reconciliation. Future discussions and research must navigate these complex waters and seek solutions that ensure both progress and protection.

Title: SLD with and without ADHD: Comparison of cognitive profiles.
Year: 2023
Authors: Verma Nitisha, Pawar Kalpana D, Shah Henal R, Shelke Swati B
Abstract: A quarter of children with Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) have a comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which impacts the testing of intelligence. ADHD is therefore treated before proceeding with the assessment of intelligence. It is expected that the treatment of ADHD will mitigate its effects on intelligence testing. Though this is frequently done in clinical practice, we could not find any study comparing IQ profiles of children having SLD with and without ADHD after treating ADHD to look for any changes between them. Therefore, we planned this study to compare the cognitive profiles of children having SLD with and without ADHD and describe any difference in their profiles. It was a retrospective cross-sectional study. We compared 695 children having SLD with treated ADHD to 721 children having SLD without ADHD on their WISC III profiles. We found that children having SLD with treated ADHD scored significantly lower on Digit Span and Coding. We suggest routine use of Cognitive Working Memory Training, peer tutoring, and task modifications in children having SLD with ADHD along with medicines and remedial education for better outcomes.

Year: 2024
Authors: Xu Tingting, Su Heng, He Biao, Tian Aohua, Guo Jianing
Abstract: The study developed a framework to investigate the impact of multiple spatial and temporal resolutions on urban growth simulation. The research utilized the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model and three regular models and data from 2009 to 2017 to simulate the urban area of Liangjiang New District in 2018 and determine the optimal spatiotemporal resolution for urban expansion models. The results indicated that the ConvLSTM model has the best simulation result and the ideal temporal resolution for Liangjiang district is to include the previous two years of data, with an optimal spatial resolution of 90 m and a spatiotemporal simulation zone within a two-year time step and 100 × 100 spatial information filter. At this combination, the kappa value of the ConvLSTM is 0.87 which is about 5% higher than others. Our findings revealed that the characteristics of input data can have a significant impact on simulation results and should be carefully considered during the simulation process.

Title: Human-Machine Collaboration for Accelerated Discovery of Promising Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts with On-Demand Elements.
Year: 2023
Authors: Sakaushi Ken, Hoisang Watcharaporn, Tamura Ryo
Abstract: A drastically efficient method for identifying electrocatalysts with desirable functionality is a pressing necessity for making a breakthrough in advanced water-electrolyzers toward large-scale green hydrogen production and addressing the significant challenge of carbon neutrality. Despite extensive investigations over the last several centuries, it remains a time-consuming task to identify even one promising affordable electrocatalyst without platinum-group-metal (PGM) for one electrochemical reaction due to its great complexities, particularly for the key anode reaction in the water-electrolyzer of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we demonstrate that a human-machine collaboration based on stepwise-evolving artificial intelligence (se-AI) can significantly shorten the development period of PGM-free multimetal OER electrocatalysts with performance beyond a PGM of RuO<sub>2</sub>. We were able to reach optimized materials only after 2% experimental trials of the entire candidate pool. The best PGM-free electrocatalyst discovered exhibited excellent activity comparable to RuO<sub>2</sub> and, surprisingly, also demonstrated superior stability with a high current density of up to 1000 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at even pH 9.2, which condition is a thermodynamically challenging for typical PGM-free materials. This work illustrates that human's material discovery can be significantly accelerated through collaboration with AI.

Title: The Management of Diabetes with Hyperuricemia: Can We Hit Two Birds with One Stone?
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Yunyang, Lu Jie
Abstract: Serum urate (SU) is an independent predictor for the incidence of diabetes. In current diabetes treatment regimens, there is insufficient appreciation of the importance of hyperuricemia (HU) in disease control and prevention. To summarize the updated knowledge on the effects of SU on β-cell function, insulin resistance and chronic diabetic complications, as well as to evaluate the management of patients with both HU and diabetes, we searched the MEDLINE PubMed database, and included 285 journal articles. An inverted U-shaped relationship between fasting plasma glucose and SU levels was established in this review. Elevated SU levels may enhance the development of chronic diabetic complications, including macrovascular and microvascular dysfunction. Diet and exercise are essential parts of the lifestyle changes necessary for HU and diabetes management. Glucose- and urate-lowering drug selection and combination should be made with the principle of ameliorating, and at least not deteriorating, diabetes and HU. Medical artificial intelligence technology and monitoring systems can help to improve the effectiveness of long-term management of HU and diabetes through digital healthcare. This study comprehensively reviews and provides a scientific and reliable basis for and viewpoints on the clinical management of diabetes and HU.

Abstract: Non-neural extracellular matrix (ECM) has limited application in humanized physiological neural modeling due to insufficient brain-specificity and safety concerns. Although brain-derived ECM contains enriched neural components, certain essential components are partially lost during the decellularization process, necessitating augmentation. Here, it is demonstrated that the laminin-augmented porcine brain-decellularized ECM (P-BdECM) is xenogeneic factor-depleted as well as favorable for the regulation of human neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. P-BdECM composition is comparable to human BdECM regarding brain-specificity through the matrisome and gene ontology-biological process analysis. As augmenting strategy, laminin 111 supplement promotes neural function by synergic effect with laminin 521 in P-BdECM. Annexin A1(ANXA1) and Peroxiredoxin(PRDX) in P-BdECM stabilized microglial and astrocytic behavior under normal while promoting active neuroinflammation in response to neuropathological factors. Further, supplementation of the brain-specific molecule to non-neural matrix also ameliorated glial cell inflammation as in P-BdECM. In conclusion, P-BdECM-augmentation strategy can be used to recapitulate humanized pathophysiological cerebral environments for neurological study.

Title: Reprogrammable Metamaterial Processors for Soft Machines.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiao Zhongdong, Hu Zhenhan, Dong Zeyu, Tang Wei, Yang Huayong, Zou Jun
Abstract: Soft metamaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their remarkable properties. These materials hold the potential to program and control the morphing behavior of soft machines, however, their combination is limited by the poor reprogrammability of metamaterials and incompatible communication between them. Here, printable and recyclable soft metamaterials possessing reprogrammable embedded intelligence to regulate the morphing of soft machines are introduced. These metamaterials are constructed from interconnected and periodically arranged logic unit cells that are able to perform compound logic operations coupling multiplication and negation. The scalable computation capacity of the unit cell empowers it to simultaneously process multiple fluidic signals with different types and magnitudes, thereby allowing the execution of sophisticated and high-level control operations. By establishing the laws of physical Boolean algebra and formulating a universal design route, soft metamaterials capable of diverse logic operations can be readily created and reprogrammed. Besides, the metamaterials' potential of directly serving as fluidic processors for soft machines is validated by constructing a soft latched demultiplexer, soft controllers capable of universal and customizable morphing programming, and a reprogrammable processor without reconnection. This work provides a facile way to create reprogrammable soft fluidic control systems to meet on-demand requirements in dynamic situations.

Abstract: Tumor metastasis remains a leading factor in the failure of cancer treatments and patient mortality. To address this, a silver-induced absorption red-shifted core-shell nano-particle is developed, and surface-modified with triphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) to obtain a novel nanodiagnosis-treatment agent (Ag@CuS-TPP@HA). This diagnosis-treatment agent can dual-targets cancer cells and mitochondria, and exhibits maximal light absorption at 1064 nm, thereby enhancing nesr-infrared II (NIR-II) photoacoustic (PA) signal and photothermal effects under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Additionally, the silver in Ag@CuS-TPP@HA can catalyze the Fenton-like reactions with H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in the tumor tissue, yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS production, coupled with enhanced photothermal effects, instigates immunogenic cell death (ICD), leading to a substantial release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and damage-associated molecular patterns, which have improved the tumor immune suppression microenvironment and boosting immune checkpoint blockade therapy, thus stimulating a systemic antitumor immune response. Hence, Ag@CuS-TPP@HA, as a cancer diagnostic-treatment agent, not only accomplishes targeted the NIR-II PA imaging of tumor tissue and addresses the challenge of accurate diagnosis of deep cancer tissue in vivo, but it also leverages ROS/photothermal therapy to enhance immune checkpoint blockade, thereby eliminating primary tumors and effectively inhibiting distant tumor growth.

Title: Stimulus-responsive biomaterials for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shan Tiantian, Chen Xi, Zhou Xinxuan, Wang Nanxi, Ren Biao, Cheng Lei
Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the only bacterium classified as a type I (definite) carcinogen, is strongly associated with the development of gastric inflammation and adenocarcinoma. It infects the stomach of approximately half of the global population, equivalent to nearly 4.4 billion people. However, due to physiological barriers in the stomach, microbial barriers and increased antibiotic resistance, the therapeutic efficiency of standard antibiotic therapy is limited and cannot meet the clinical needs in some areas. Combining stimulus-responsive biomaterials with certain stimuli is an emerging antibacterial strategy. Stimulus-responsive biomaterials can respond to chemical, biological or physical cues in the environment with corresponding changes in their own properties and functions, highlighting a more intelligent, targeting and efficient aspect for H. pylori therapy.

Title: Adaptive smoothing of retinotopic maps based on Teichmüller parametrization.
Year: 2023
Authors: Tu Yanshuai, Li Xin, Lu Zhong-Lin, Wang Yalin
Abstract: Retinotopic mapping, the mapping between visual inputs on the retina and neural responses on the cortical surface, is one of the fundamental topics in visual neuroscience. In human studies, retinotopic maps are conventionally constructed and processed by decoding blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to designed visual stimuli on the cortical surface. However, these methods frequently generate retinotopic maps that do not preserve topology, contradicting a fundamental property of retinotopic maps observed in neurophysiology. To address this problem, we propose an integrated approach to simultaneously refine the flattening from the 3D cortical surface to the 2D parametric space and adaptively smooth retinotopic perception centers in the visual space to make the retinotopic maps topological. One key element of the approach is the enhanced error tolerant Teichmüller mapping, which refines the parametrization by minimizing angle distortions and maximizing alignment to noisy landmarks. We validated our overall approach with synthetic and real retinotopic mapping datasets and applied it to compute cortical magnification factor (CMF). The results showed that the proposed approach was superior to other conventional retinotopic mapping methods in predicting BOLD fMRI time series and preserving topology.

Authors: Chen Han, Zhou Shenghan, Chen Junbiao, Zhou Jin, Fan Kai, Pan Yuxiang, Ping Jianfeng
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of glucose concentration changes in plants and access to plant physiological information timely are of great significance to the development of precision agriculture. Here, we innovatively present an electrochemical sensing device that combines microneedle sensors and 3D printing technology to achieve real-time monitoring of glucose in plants in a minimally invasive manner. The device consists of two components: the inner part features a highly efficient sensing interface based on platinum wire (MPt-Au-Nafion-GOx-Pu), while the outer part consists of polymer microneedles formed by 3D printing. Additionally, the polymer hollow microneedle features a slender tip diameter of only 300 μm, minimizing plant damage during the detection procedure. The device shows good detection performance, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 33.3 μM and a detection sensitivity of 17 nA/μM·cm<sup>2</sup>. It can detect glucose concentrations in the range of 100 μM to 100 mM, providing a unique solution for timely agronomic management of crops tool. By performing 12 h real-time monitoring and salt stress treat on tomato and aloe vera, the results verified the feasibility of integrated device applied to real-time glucose detection in plants.

Title: Sulfur vacancy defects mediated CdZnTeS@BC heterojunction: Artificial intelligence-assisted self-enhanced electrochemiluminescence molecularly imprinted sensing of CTC.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Yanying, Dai Shijie, Liu Tao, Wu Chun, Sun Mengmeng, Su Gehong, Ye Jianshan, Wang Xianxing, He Jie, Rao Hanbing, Lu Zhiwei
Abstract: Environmental pollution caused by tetracycline antibiotics is a major concern of global public health. Here, a novel and portable molecularly imprinted electrochemiluminescence (MIECL) sensor based on smartphones for highly sensitive detection of chlortetracycline (CTC) has been successfully established. The high-performance ECL emitter of biomass carbon (BC) encapsulated CdZnTeS (CdZnTeS@BC) was successfully synthesized by hydrothermal. The enhanced ECL performance was ascribed to the introduction of the BC and increased the overall electrical conductivity of the nanoemitter, as well as increased the number of sulfur vacancies and doping on the surface of the emitter based on density functional theory calculations. An aniline-CTC molecular imprinted polymer was synthesized on the surface of the CdZnTeS@BC modified electrode by in-situ electropolymerization. The decrease in MIECL signal was attributed to the increase in impedance effect. The MIECL nanoplatform enabled a wide linear relationship in the range of 0.05-100 μmol/L with a detection limit of 0.029 μmol/L for spectrometer sensors. Interestingly, the light emitted during the MIECL reaction can be captured by a smartphone. Thus, machine learning was used to screen the photos that were taken, and color analysis was carried out on the screened photos by self-developed software, thus achieving a portable, convenient, and intelligent sensing mode. Finally, the sensor obtains satisfactory results in the detection of actual samples, with no significant differences from those of liquid chromatography.

Title: Instantaneous estimation of momentary affective responses using neurophysiological signals and a spatiotemporal emotional intensity regression network.
Year: 2023
Authors: Gan Kaiyu, Li Ruiding, Zhang Jianhua, Sun Zhanquan, Yin Zhong
Abstract: Previous studies in affective computing often use a fixed emotional label to train an emotion classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) from individuals experiencing an affective stimulus. However, EEGs encode emotional dynamics that include varying intensities within a given emotional category. To investigate these variations in emotional intensity, we propose a framework that obtains momentary affective labels for fine-grained segments of EEGs with human feedback. We then model these labeled segments using a novel spatiotemporal emotional intensity regression network (STEIR-Net). It integrates temporal EEG patterns from nine predefined cortical regions to provide a continuous estimation of emotional intensity. We demonstrate that the STEIR-Net outperforms classical regression models by reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by an average of 4∼9 % and 2∼4 % for the SEED and SEED-IV databases, respectively. We find that the frontal and temporal cortical regions contribute significantly to the affective intensity's variation. Higher absolute values of the Spearman correlation coefficient between the model estimation and momentary affective labels under happiness (0.2114) and fear (0.2072) compared to neutral (0.1694) and sad (0.1895) emotions were observed. Besides, increasing the input length of the EEG segments from 4 to 20 s further reduces the RMSE from 1.3548 to 1.3188.

Title: Adversarially robust neural networks with feature uncertainty learning and label embedding.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Ran, Ke Haopeng, Hu Meng, Wu Wenhui
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to the attacks of adversarial examples, which bring serious security risks to the learning systems. In this paper, we propose a new defense method to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs based on stochastic neural networks (SNNs), termed as Margin-SNN. The proposed Margin-SNN mainly includes two modules, i.e., feature uncertainty learning module and label embedding module. The first module introduces uncertainty to the latent feature space by giving each sample a distributional representation rather than a fixed point representation, and leverages the advantages of variational information bottleneck method in achieving good intra-class compactness in latent space. The second module develops a label embedding mechanism to take advantage of the semantic information underlying the labels, which maps the labels into the same latent space with the features, in order to capture the similarity between sample and its class centroid, where a penalty term is equipped to elegantly enlarge the margin between different classes for better inter-class separability. Since no adversarial information is introduced, the proposed model can be learned in standard training to improve adversarial robustness, which is much more efficient than adversarial training. Extensive experiments on data sets MNIST, FASHION MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN demonstrate superior defensive ability of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/humeng24/Margin-SNN.

Title: Multifunctional Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF for simultaneous quantification of malachite green and leuco-malachite green and efficient adsorption of malachite green.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xia Yi-Fan, Yuan Hou-Qun, Qiao Chen, Li Wei, Wang Ran, Chen Peiyao, Li Yan-Xia, Bao Guang-Ming
Abstract: Multi-target detection combined with in-situ removal of contaminants is a challenging issue difficult to overcome. Herein, a dual-emissive Eu<sup>3+</sup>-metal organic framework (Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF) was constructed by pre-functionalization with a blue-emissive ligand and post-functionalization with red-emissive Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions using a UiO-66 precursor. The fluorescence of the synthesized Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF is highly selective and sensitive toward malachite green (MG) and its metabolite leuco-malachite green (LMG), which are environmentally persistent and highly toxic to humans. The limit of detection of MG and LMG are 34.20 and 1.98 nM, respectively. Interestingly, the fluorescence of this Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF showed ratiometric but different responsive modes toward MG and LMG, which enabled the simultaneous quantification of MG and LMG. Furthermore, a paper-based sensor combined with the smartphone was fabricated, which facilitated not only the dual-channel detection of MG, but also its portable, visual, rapid, and intelligent determination. Furthermore, the high surface area of MOFs, together with the coordinate bonding interaction, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interaction sites, endows Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF with the efficient ability toward MG removal. This multifunctional Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF can be successfully used for trace detection, simultaneous determination of MG and LMG, as well as efficient removal of MG. Thus, it exhibits bright prospects for widespread applications in the field of food and environmental analysis.

Title: RNAkines are secreted messengers shaping health and disease.
Year: 2023
Authors: Li Jing, Fang Jingwen, Jiang Xiaohong, Zhang Yujing, Vidal-Puig Antonio, Zhang Chen-Yu
Abstract: Extracellular noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have crucial roles in intercellular communications. The process of ncRNA secretion is highly regulated, with specific ncRNA profiles produced under different physiological and pathological circumstances. These ncRNAs are transported primarily via extracellular vesicles (EVs) from their origin cells to target cells, utilising both endocrine and paracrine pathways. The intercellular impacts of extracellular ncRNAs are essential for maintaining homeostasis and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Given the unique aspects of extracellular ncRNAs, here we propose the term 'RNAkine' to describe these recently identified secreted factors. We explore their roles as intercellular modulators, particularly in their ability to regulate metabolism and influence tumorigenesis, highlighting their definition and importance as a distinct class of secreted factors.

Year: 2023
Authors: Zattoni Fabio, Carletti Filippo, Randazzo Gianmarco, Tuminello Arianna, Betto Giovanni, Novara Giacomo, Dal Moro Fabrizio
Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies hold great promise in various medical fields. The release of a new generation of headsets for medical enhanced VR/AR (MER) opens new possibilities for applications in medicine, particularly in urology, to improve accessibility to everyone. These innovative headsets offer deep immersion without requiring a controller, which represents a novel approach to VR/AR engagement. The potential of these headsets applies to all aspects of urology, including surgical training, virtual meetings, communication between health care providers, patient counseling, telemedicine, delivering patient advice, and pain control. MER has the potential to improve operative planning and enhance intraoperative navigation and spatial awareness. The surgeon's visualization and overall experience can be significantly enhanced via improved guidance and visualization, ultimately leading to greater precision and safety. This cutting-edge technology has the potential to reshape urology practice, communication methods, and medical procedures, and ultimately to improve patients' experience of their urological condition. PATIENT SUMMARY: This mini review explores how a new generation of headsets for medical enhanced virtual reality could revolutionize urology by improving surgical planning, assistance during procedures, and medical education. Patients can benefit from better pain management and a deeper understanding of their conditions. However, challenges such as costs, accuracy, and ethical concerns must be addressed. This technology holds promise for transforming urological practice and patient care.

Title: Primary repair with no flaps for lower lip defects (30-80 %) after cancer excision.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yousefi M, Khoshnevis S J, Seraj M, Abbasvandi F, Sadeghi P, Khoshnevis Z, Akbari A, Hadi A, Akbari M E
Abstract: Reconstruction of the lip is a necessary procedure when lip tumors are excised. Although many good techniques have been described, they often have disadvantages such as necrosis and extensive suture lines. In our approach, we aim to minimize the suture line and avoid tissue necrosis for medium-sized lip defects (30-80 %). This is a surgical technique report from a single center. After tumor resection, we made a bilateral 15 mm horizontal skin and mucosa incision from the angles of the lip to the lateral sides. The mucosa and skin were dissected from the underlying muscle, and the muscle was cut approximately 15 mm on each side. The lip defect was then closed and sutured in four layers. Finally, the released mucosa was sutured to the corner of the incised skin. We followed the patients for 36 months and found that their speech intelligibility, sensation, mobility, and aesthetic satisfaction were preserved. The scars were also less pronounced compared to flaps, and there were no signs of edema or drooling. In conclusion, our technique offers many advantages for moderate defects of lower lip tumors. By avoiding the use of flaps, we eliminate the complications associated with flap surgery while achieving aesthetically satisfactory results. However, further evaluation by other surgeons is necessary to fully examine the technique's benefits.

Title: Quo Vadis Hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI?
Year: 2023
Authors: Wodtke Pascal, Grashei Martin, Schilling Franz
Abstract: Over the last two decades, hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI has gained significance in both preclinical and clinical studies, hereby relying on technologies like PHIP-SAH (ParaHydrogen-Induced Polarization-Side Arm Hydrogenation), SABRE (Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange), and dDNP (dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization), with dDNP being applied in humans. A clinical dDNP polarizer has enabled studies across 24 sites, despite challenges like high cost and slow polarization. Parahydrogen-based techniques like SABRE and PHIP offer faster, more cost-efficient alternatives but require molecule-specific optimization. The focus has been on imaging metabolism of hyperpolarized probes, which requires long T<sub>1</sub>, high polarization and rapid contrast generation. Efforts to establish novel probes, improve acquisition techniques and enhance data analysis methods including artificial intelligence are ongoing. Potential clinical value of hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI was demonstrated primarily for treatment response assessment in oncology, but also in cardiology, nephrology, hepatology and CNS characterization. In this review on biomedical hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI, we summarize important and recent advances in polarization techniques, probe development, acquisition and analysis methods as well as clinical trials. Starting from those we try to sketch a trajectory where the field of biomedical hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI might go.

Title: A macrophage cell membrane-coated cascade-targeting photothermal nanosystem for combating intracellular bacterial infections.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xiong Jingdi, Tang Haiqin, Sun Lizhong, Zhu Jieyu, Tao Siying, Luo Jun, Li Jiyao, Li Jianshu, Wu Hongkun, Yang Jiaojiao
Abstract: Current antibacterial interventions encounter formidable challenges when confronting intracellular bacteria, attributable to their clustering within phagocytes, particularly macrophages, evading host immunity and resisting antibiotics. Herein, we have developed an intelligent cell membrane-based nanosystem, denoted as MM@DAu NPs, which seamlessly integrates cascade-targeting capabilities with controllable antibacterial functions for the precise elimination of intracellular bacteria. MM@DAu NPs feature a core comprising D-alanine-functionalized gold nanoparticles (DAu NPs) enveloped by a macrophage cell membrane (MM) coating. Upon administration, MM@DAu NPs harness the intrinsic homologous targeting ability of their macrophage membrane to infiltrate bacteria-infected macrophages. Upon internalization within these host cells, exposed DAu NPs from MM@DAu NPs selectively bind to intracellular bacteria through the bacteria-targeting agent, D-alanine present on DAu NPs. This intricate process establishes a cascade mechanism that efficiently targets intracellular bacteria. Upon exposure to near-infrared irradiation, the accumulated DAu NPs surrounding intracellular bacteria induce local hyperthermia, enabling precise clearance of intracellular bacteria. Further validation in animal models infected with the typical intracellular bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, substantiates the exceptional cascade-targeting efficacy and photothermal antibacterial potential of MM@DAu NPs in vivo. Therefore, this integrated cell membrane-based cascade-targeting photothermal nanosystem offers a promising approach for conquering persistent intracellular infections without drug resistance risks. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Intracellular bacterial infections lead to treatment failures and relapses because intracellular bacteria could cluster within phagocytes, especially macrophages, evading the host immune system and resisting antibiotics. Herein, we have developed an intelligent cell membrane-based nanosystem MM@DAu NPs, which is designed to precisely eliminate intracellular bacteria through a controllable cascade-targeting photothermal antibacterial approach. MM@DAu NPs combine D-alanine-functionalized gold nanoparticles with a macrophage cell membrane coating. Upon administration, MM@DAu NPs harness the homologous targeting ability of macrophage membrane to infiltrate bacteria-infected macrophages. Upon internalization, exposed DAu NPs from MM@DAu NPs selectively bind to intracellular bacteria through the bacteria-targeting agent, enabling precise clearance of intracellular bacteria through local hyperthermia. This integrated cell membrane-based cascade-targeting photothermal nanosystem offers a promising avenue for conquering persistent intracellular infections without drug resistance risks.

Title: Discovery of Kinetin in inhibiting colorectal cancer progression via enhancing PSMB1-mediated RAB34 degradation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiang Xuefei, Yang Lanlan, Chen Guanxing, Feng Xingzhi, Liu Yiting, Gao Qianling, Mai Mingru, Chen Calvin Yu-Chian, Ye Shubiao, Yang Zihuan
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Understanding the underlying mechanism driving CRC progression and identifying potential therapeutic drug targets are of utmost urgency. We previously utilized LC-MS-based proteomic profiling to identify proteins associated with postoperative progression in stage II/III CRC. Here, we revealed that proteasome subunit beta type-1 (PSMB1) is an independent predictor for postoperative progression in stage II/III CRC. Mechanistically, PSMB1 binds directly to onco-protein RAB34 and promotes its proteasome-dependent degradation, potentially leading to the inactivation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and inhibition of CRC progression. To further identify potential anticancer drugs, we screened a library of 2509 FDA-approved drugs using computer-aided drug design (CADD) and identified Kinetin as a potentiating agent for PSMB1. Functional assays confirmed that Kinetin enhanced the interaction between PSMB1 and RAB34, hence facilitated the degradation of RAB34 protein and decreased the MEK/ERK phosphorylation. Kinetin suppresses CRC progression in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and liver metastasis models. Conclusively, our study identifies PSMB1 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and Kinetin as an anticancer drug by enhancing proteasome-dependent onco-protein degradation.

Title: Effects of environmental microplastic exposure on Chlorella sp. biofilm characteristics and its interaction with nitric oxide signaling.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Ying, Wang Jian-Xia, Liu Yang, Zhang Jing-Tian, Wang Jing-Han, Chi Zhan-You
Abstract: Microalgal biofilm is promising in simultaneous pollutants removal, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and biomass resource transformation when wastewater is used as culturing medium. Nitric oxide (NO) often accumulates in microalgal cells under wastewater treatment relevant abiotic stresses such as nitrogen deficiency, heavy metals, and antibiotics. However, the influence of emerging contaminants such as microplastics (MPs) on microalgal intracellular NO is still unknown. Moreover, the investigated MPs concentrations among existing studies were mostly several magnitudes higher than in real wastewaters, which could offer limited guidance for the effects of MPs on microalgae at environment-relevant concentrations. Therefore, this study investigated three commonly observed MPs in wastewater at environment-relevant concentrations (10-10,000 μg/L) and explored their impacts on attached Chlorella sp. growth characteristics, nutrients removal, and anti-oxidative responses (including intracellular NO content). The nitrogen source NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N at 49 mg/L being 20 % of the nitrogen strength in classic BG-11 medium was selected for MPs exposure experiments because of least intracellular NO accumulation, so that disturbance of intracellular NO by nitrogen availability could be avoided. Under such condition, 10 μg/L polyethylene (PE) MPs displayed most significant microalgal growth inhibition comparing with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (PA) MPs, showing extraordinarily low chlorophyll a/b ratios, and highest superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and intracellular NO content after 12 days of MPs exposure. PVC MPs exposed cultures displayed highest malonaldehyde (MDA) content because of the toxic characteristics of organochlorines, and most significant correlations of intracellular NO content with conventional anti-oxidative parameters of SOD, CAT (catalase), and MDA. MPs accelerated phosphorus removal, and the type rather than concentration of MPs displayed higher influences, following the trend of PE > PA > PVC. This study expanded the knowledge of microalgal biofilm under environment-relevant concentrations of MPs, and innovatively discovered the significance of intracellular NO as a more sensitive indicator than conventional anti-oxidative parameters under MPs exposure.

Abstract: In order to deepen our understanding of the virus and help guide the creation of efficient therapies, this study uses artificial intelligence tools to thoroughly explore the genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The process starts by using the Fuzzy Closure Miner for Frequent Itemsets (FCMFI) on a large corpus of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to reveal hidden patterns, including nucleotides base sequences, repeating motifs, and corresponding interchanges. Then, using the Nucleotide Sequence Comprehension Engine (NSCE) technique, we were able to precisely define the genomic areas for mutation analysis. Structured and unstructured proteins are both strongly impacted by virus mutations, with spike proteins that are linked to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia being particularly affected. Notably, the Mutagenic Anomaly Detector shows a 65 % efficiency boost in computing genome mutation rates compared to conventional point mutation analysis, while GenoAnalyzer offers a remarkable 93.33 % improvement over existing approaches in recognizing common genomic sequence patterns. These results highlight the potential of FCMFI to reveal complex genomic patterns and significant insights in COVID-19 genetic sequences when combined with mutation analysis. The Mutagenic Anomaly Detector and GenoAnalyzer show promise for revealing hidden genomic patterns and precisely estimating the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate.

Title: Identification and characterization of both cis- and trans-regulators mediating fenvalerate-induced expression of CYP6B7 in Helicoverpa armigera.
Year: 2023
Authors: Huang Yun, Xu Li, Zheng Junyue, Wu Peizhuo, Zhang Yu, Qiu Lihong
Abstract: As we known, inducibility is an important feature of P450 genes. Previous studies indicated that CYP6B7 could be induced and involved in fenvalerate detoxification in Helicoverpa armigera. However, the regulatory mechanism of CYP6B7 induced by fenvalerate is still unclear. In this study, CYP6B7 promoter of H. armigera was cloned and the cis-acting element of fenvalerate was identified to be located between -84 and - 55 bp of CYP6B7 promoter. Subsequently, 33 candidate transcription factors (CYP6B7-fenvalerate association proteins, CAPs) that may bind to the cis-acting element were screened and verified by yeast one-hybrid. Among them, the expression levels of several CAPs were significantly induced by fenvalerate. Knockdown of juvenile hormone-binding protein-like (JHBP), RNA polymerase II-associated protein 3 (RPAP3), fatty acid synthase-like (FAS) and peptidoglycan recognition protein LB-like (PGRP) resulted in significant expression inhibition of CYP6B7, and increased sensitivity of H. armigera to fenvalerate. Co-transfection of reporter gene p (-84/-55) with pFast-CAP showed that JHBP, RPAP3 and PGRP could significantly increase the activity of CYP6B7 promoter. These results suggested that trans-acting factors JHBP, RPAP3 and PGRP may bind with cis-acting elements to regulate the expression of CYP6B7 induced by fenvalerate, and play an important role in the detoxification of H. armigera to fenvalerate.

Abstract: The current investigation examines the effectiveness of various approaches in predicting the soil texture class (clay, silt, and sand contents) of the Rawalpindi district, Punjab province, Pakistan. The employed techniques included artificial neural networks (ANNs), kriging, co-kriging, and inverse distance weighting (IDW). A total of 44 soil specimens from depths of 10-15 cm were gathered, and then the hydrometer method was adopted to measure their texture. The map of soil grain sets was formulated in the ArcGIS environment, utilizing distinct interpolation approaches. The MATLAB software was used to evaluate soil texture. The gradient fraction, latitude and longitude, elevation, and soil texture fragments of points were proposed to an ANN. Several statistical values, such as correlation coefficient (R), geometric mean error ratios (GMER), and root mean square error (RMSE), were utilized to evaluate the precision of the intended techniques. In assessing grain size and spatial dissemination of clay, silt, and sand, the effectiveness and precision of ANN were superior compared to kriging, co-kriging, and inverse distance weighting. Still, less than a 50% correlation was observed using the ANN. In this examination, the IDW had inferior precision compared to the other approaches. The results demonstrated that the practices produced acceptable results and can be used for future research. Soil texture is among the most central variables that can manipulate agriculture plans. The prepared maps exhibiting the soil texture groups are imperative for crop yield and pastoral scheduling.

Title: Innovations in Spine Surgery: A Narrative Review of Current Integrative Technologies.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bcharah George, Gupta Nithin, Panico Nicholas, Winspear Spencer, Bagley Austin, Turnow Morgan, D'Amico Randy, Ukachukwu Alvan-Emeka
Abstract: Neurosurgical technologies have become increasingly more adaptive, featuring real-time and patient-specific guidance in pre, intra, and postoperative settings. This review offers insight on how these integrative innovations compare to conventional approaches in spine surgery, focusing on Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), and Spinal Navigation Systems. Data on technology applications, diagnostic and procedural accuracy, intraoperative times, radiation exposures, post-operative outcomes, and costs were extracted and compared to conventional methods to assess their advantages and limitations. Preoperatively, AR and VR have applications in surgical training and planning that are more immersive, case-specific, and risk-free and have been shown to enhance accuracy and reduce complications. In addition, ML algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting surgical candidacy (up to 92.1%) and tailoring personalized treatments based on patient-specific variables. Intraoperatively, advantages include more accurate pedicle screw insertion (96-99% with ML), enhanced visualization, reduced radiation exposure (49 μSv with O-arm navigation vs. 556 μSv with fluoroscopy), increased efficiency, and potential for fewer intraoperative complications compared to conventional approaches. Postoperatively, certain ML and AI models have outperformed conventional methods in predicting all post-operative complications of 6000+ patients as well as predicting variables contributing to in-hospital and 90-day mortality. However, applying these technologies comes with limitations, such as longer operative times (up to 35.6% longer) with navigation, dataset dependencies, costs, accessibility, steep learning curve, and inherent software malfunctions. As these technologies advance, continuing to assess their efficacy and limitations will be imperative in their integration within spine surgery.

Title: How drivers perform under different scenarios: Ability-related driving style extraction for large-scale dataset.
Year: 2024
Authors: Zang Yingbang, Wen Licheng, Cai Pinlong, Fu Daocheng, Mao Song, Shi Botian, Li Yikang, Lu Guangquan
Abstract: The extraction and analysis of driving style are essential for a comprehensive understanding of human driving behaviours. Most existing studies rely on subjective questionnaires and specific experiments, posing challenges in accurately capturing authentic characteristics of group drivers in naturalistic driving scenarios. As scenario-oriented naturalistic driving data collected by advanced sensors becomes increasingly available, the application of data-driven methods allows for a exhaustive analysis of driving styles across multiple drivers. Following a theoretical differentiation of driving ability, driving performance, and driving style with essential clarifications, this paper proposes a quantitative determination method grounded in large-scale naturalistic driving data. Initially, this paper defines and derives driving ability and driving performance through trajectory optimisation modelling considering various cost indicators. Subsequently, this paper proposes an objective driving style extraction method grounded in the Gaussian mixture model. In the experimental phase, this study employs the proposed framework to extract both driving abilities and performances from the Waymo motion dataset, subsequently determining driving styles. This determination is accomplished through the establishment of quantifiable statistical distributions designed to mirror data characteristics. Furthermore, the paper investigates the distinctions between driving styles in different scenarios, utilising the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The empirical findings substantiate correlations between driving styles and specific scenarios, encompassing both congestion and non-congestion as well as intersection and non-intersection scenarios.

Title: A bubble-enhanced lanthanide-doped up/down-conversion platform with tumor microenvironment response for dual-modal photoacoustic and near-infrared-II fluorescence imaging.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xu Yuening, Liang Haoran, Zeng Qingtan, He Fei, Liu Changlin, Gai Shili, Ding He, Yang Piaoping
Abstract: As an important tumor diagnosis strategy in precision medicine, multimodal imaging has been widely studied. However, the weak imaging signal with low spatial resolution and the constant signal of lack of specific activation severely limit its disease diagnosis. Herein, a bubble-enhanced lanthanide-based up/down-conversion platform with tumor microenvironment response for dual-mode imaging, LDNP@DMSN-Au@CaCO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles (named as LDAC NPs) were successfully developed. Combining the advantages of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging (FI), significantly improved the accuracy of diseases diagnosis. LDAC NPs with flower-like structure were synthesized through the encapsulation of uniform lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (NaYbF<sub>4</sub>:Ce,Er@NaYF<sub>4</sub> named LDNPs) with dendritic mesoporous silica (DMSN). The gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were then in situ grown on the surface of DMSN and the surface were finally coated with a layer of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Under the excitation of the 980 nm laser, LDNPs showed strong emission of NIR-II at 1550 nm due to the doping of Ce and Er ions, showcasing excellent spatial resolution and deep tissue penetration characteristics, while the resulting visible light emission (540 nm) enables Au NPs to generate PAI signals with the aid of LDNPs via the fluorescence resonance energy transfer effect. In acidic tumoral environment, CaCO<sub>3</sub> layer could produce CO<sub>2</sub> microbubbles, and the PAI signals of LDAC NPs could be further enhanced with the generation of CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles due to the bubble cavitation effect. Simultaneously, the NIR-II FI of LDAC NPs was self-enhanced with the degradation of the CaCO<sub>3</sub>. This intelligent nanoparticle with stimulus-activated dual-mode imaging capability holds great promise in future precision diagnostics.

Authors: Liu Zhenyu, Wei Wujun, Zhang Junning, Yang Xueli, Feng Zhihui, Zhang Biao, Hou Xianliang
Abstract: Multiple sclerosis(MS), primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) share numerous clinical symptoms and serological characteristics. We analyzed 153550 cells of scRNA-seq data of 17 treatment-naive patients (5 MS, 5 pSS, and 7 SLE) and 10 healthy controls, and we examined the enrichment of biological processes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), immune cell types, and their subpopulations, and cell-cell communication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The percentage of B cells, megakaryocytes, monocytes, and proliferating T cells presented significant changes in autoimmune diseases. The enrichment of cell types based on gene expression revealed an elevated monocyte. MIF, MK, and GALECTIN signaling networks were obvious differences in autoimmune diseases. Taken together, our analysis provides a comprehensive map of the cell types and states of ADs patients at the single-cell level to understand better the pathogenesis and treatment of these ADs.

Title: Deep learning innovations in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy: The potential of transfer learning and the DiaCNN model.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shoaib Mohamed R, Emara Heba M, Zhao Jun, El-Shafai Walid, Soliman Naglaa F, Mubarak Ahmed S, Omer Osama A, El-Samie Fathi E Abd, Esmaiel Hamada
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant cause of vision impairment, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and timely intervention to avert visual deterioration. Diagnosing DR is inherently complex, as it necessitates the meticulous examination of intricate retinal images by experienced specialists. This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of these medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing. Remarkably, the DiaCNN model showcased unparalleled precision, achieving 100% accuracy in training and 98.3% in testing. These figures represent a significant leap in classification accuracy when juxtaposed with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Such advancements hold immense promise for the future, emphasizing the potential of our proposed technique to revolutionize the accuracy of DR and other eye disease diagnoses. By facilitating earlier detection and more timely interventions, this approach stands poised to significantly reduce the incidence of blindness associated with DR, thus heralding a new era of improved patient outcomes. Therefore, this work, through its novel approach and stellar results, not only pushes the boundaries of DR diagnostic accuracy but also promises a transformative impact in early detection and intervention, aiming to substantially diminish DR-induced blindness and champion enhanced patient care.

Title: Dual-crosslinking immunostimulatory hydrogel synchronously suppresses pancreatic fistula and pancreatic cancer relapse post-resection.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhao Ruizhi, Xiao Qiuqun, Wu Yuanyuan, Zhang Weiqi, Liu Jiale, Zeng Yinghua, Zhan Jie, Cai Yanbin, Fang Chihua
Abstract: In pancreatic cancer (PC), surgical resection remains the sole curative option, albeit patients undergoing resection are susceptible to postoperative pancreatic fistula (PF) formation and tumor recurrence. An unmet need exists for a unified strategy capable of concomitantly averting PF and tumor relapse to mitigate morbidity in PC patients after surgery. Herein, an original dual crosslinked biological sealant hydrogel (methacrylate-hyaluronic acid-dopamine (MA-HA-DA) and sulfhydryl-hyaluronic acid-dopamine (SH-HA-DA)) was engineered as a drug depot and loaded with polydopamine-cloaked cytokine interleukin-15 and platelets conjugated with anti-TIGIT. In vitro analyses validated favorable tissue adhesion, cytocompatibility, and stability of the hydrogels. In a PF rodent model, the hydrogel effectively adhered to the pancreatic stump, sealing the severed pancreatic end and impeding post-operative elevations in amylase and lipase. In PC murine models, hydrogels potently stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells to deter residual tumor re-growth and distant metastasis. This innovative hydrogel strategy establishes a new framework for concomitant prevention of PF and PC recurrence.

Title: Determination of parabens in breast milk using stir bar sorptive extraction coupled with UHPLC-UV.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ge Xue, Feng Senwei, Bian Linlin, Wang Mingjuan, Li Kefeng, Wang Xu
Abstract: We developed an analytical method based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, using a stir bar coated with amino/hydroxyl bifunctional microporous organic network (B-MON), for the analysis of parabens in breast milk samples. B-MON demonstrated superior performance with maximal methylparaben adsorption of 112.15 mg/g. Kinetic fitting revealed that outer diffusion was the key limiting step, and the adsorption was chemisorption. The thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that increased methylparaben adsorption was found at higher temperatures in spontaneous processes. The developed approach showed excellent linearity (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9964) and a low detection limit (0.01 μg/L). Recoveries ranged from 85.8 to 105.5 % and the relative standard deviation was lower than 9.2 %. Based on the daily exposure assessment, these pollutants do not pose unacceptable health hazards to babies. However, the high detection frequencies (41.9%-93.5 %) suggest that breast milk still should be monitored.

Title: Classification of light Yorkshire pigs at different production stages using ordinary least squares and machine learning methods.
Year: 2023
Authors: Casellas J, Salgado-López P, Lorente J, Diaz I Solar, Rathje T, Gasa J, Solà-Oriol D
Abstract: Pig homogeneity and growth are major concerns for the pig industry today. Variability in pigs' size has a strong impact on profitability as uniformity plays a key role in the overall economic value of pigs produced. This research focused on statistical methods to identify pigs at risk of growth retardation at different stages of production. Data from 125 083 Yorkshire pigs at weaning (18-28 d), 59 533 pigs at the end of the nursery period (70-82 d) and 48 862 pigs at slaughter (155-170 d) were analyzed under three different cut-points (lowest 10, 20 and 30%) to characterize light animals. Records were randomly split into 2:1 training:testing sets, and each training data set was analyzed through an ordinary least squares approach and four machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, and two alternative boosting approaches). A wide range of weighting functions were applied to give increased relevance to lighter pigs. Each resulting classification norm was used to classify light pigs in the testing data set. Both sensitivity and specificity were retained to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the statistical performance of each analytical approach was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). In all production stages and cut-points, the random forest machine learning algorithm provided the highest AUC, closely followed by boosting procedures. For weaning BW (WW), factors related to birth BW and litter size accounted for more than 75% of the important prediction factors for light pigs. BW at the end of the nursery period and slaughter BW analyses revealed a similar pattern where WW and BW at the end of the nursery period accounted for more than 40 and 50% of statistical importance among the prediction factors, respectively. Machine learning algorithms are useful tools to easily evaluate the risk factors affecting the efficiency and homogeneity in swine. Since the BW at birth and weaning are key factors, sow nutrition and feeding management during gestation and lactation, along with piglet management during lactation, are identified as important influences on pig weight variability.

Title: A hybrid forecasting approach for China's national carbon emission allowance prices with balanced accuracy and interpretability.
Year: 2024
Authors: Mao Yaqi, Yu Xiaobing
Abstract: A significant milestone in China's carbon market was reached with the official launch and operation of the National Carbon Emission Trading Market. The accurate prediction of the carbon price in this market is crucial for the government to formulate scientific policies regarding the carbon market and for companies to participate effectively. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to accurately predict price fluctuations in the carbon market because of the volatility and instability caused by several complex factors. This paper proposes a new carbon price forecasting framework that considers the potential factors influencing national carbon prices, including data decomposition and reconstruction techniques, feature selection techniques, machine learning forecasting techniques for intelligent optimisation, and research on model interpretability. This comprehensive framework aims to improve the accuracy and understandability of carbon price projections to respond better to the complexity and uncertainty of carbon markets. The results indicate that (1) the hybrid forecasting framework is highly accurate in forecasting national carbon market prices and far superior to other comparative models; (2) the factors driving national carbon prices vary according to the time scale. High-frequency series are sensitive to short-term economic and energy market indicators. Medium- and low-frequency series are more susceptible to financial markets and long-term economic conditions than high-frequency series. This study provides insights into the factors affecting China's national carbon market price and serves as a reference for companies and governments to develop carbon price forecasting tools.

Title: The diagnostic, therapeutic, and ethical impact of artificial intelligence in modern medicine.
Year: 2023
Authors: Katwaroo Arun Rabindra, Adesh Vivek Shanker, Lowtan Amrita, Umakanthan Srikanth
Abstract: In the evolution of modern medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to provide an integral aspect of revolutionizing clinical diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient care. With the potential to scrutinize colossal amounts of medical data, radiological and histological images, and genomic data in healthcare institutions, AI-powered systems can recognize, determine, and associate patterns and provide impactful insights that would be strenuous and challenging for clinicians to detect during their daily clinical practice. The outcome of AI-mediated search offers more accurate, personalized patient diagnoses, guides in research for new drug therapies, and provides a more effective multidisciplinary treatment plan that can be implemented for patients with chronic diseases. Among the many promising applications of AI in modern medicine, medical imaging stands out distinctly as an area with tremendous potential. AI-powered algorithms can now accurately and sensitively identify cancer cells and other lesions in medical images with greater accuracy and sensitivity. This allows for earlier diagnosis and treatment, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive insight into diagnostic, therapeutic, and ethical issues with the advent of AI in modern medicine.

Abstract: Investigating immune memory to vaccinia virus and pre-existing immunity to mpox virus (MPXV) among the population is crucial for the global response to this ongoing mpox epidemic. Blood was sampled from vaccinees inoculated with vaccinia virus Tiantan (VTT) strain born before 1981 and unvaccinated control subjects born since 1982. After at least 40 years of the inoculation, 60% or 5% VTT vaccinees possess neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to VTT or MPXV, with at least 50% having T cell memory to VTT protein antigens. Notably, 46.7% vaccinees show pre-existing T cell responses to MPXV. Broad pre-existing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivities to MPXV are detected not only against conserved epitopes but also against variant epitopes between VTT and MPXV. Persistent NAbs and T cell memory to VTT among vaccinees, along with pre-existing T cells to MPXV among both vaccinees and the unvaccinated population, indicate a particular immune barrier to mpox.

Title: Performance reserves in brain-imaging-based phenotype prediction.
Year: 2023
Authors: Schulz Marc-Andre, Bzdok Danilo, Haufe Stefan, Haynes John-Dylan, Ritter Kerstin
Abstract: This study examines the impact of sample size on predicting cognitive and mental health phenotypes from brain imaging via machine learning. Our analysis shows a 3- to 9-fold improvement in prediction performance when sample size increases from 1,000 to 1 M participants. However, despite this increase, the data suggest that prediction accuracy remains worryingly low and far from fully exploiting the predictive potential of brain imaging data. Additionally, we find that integrating multiple imaging modalities boosts prediction accuracy, often equivalent to doubling the sample size. Interestingly, the most informative imaging modality often varied with increasing sample size, emphasizing the need to consider multiple modalities. Despite significant performance reserves for phenotype prediction, achieving substantial improvements may necessitate prohibitively large sample sizes, thus casting doubt on the practical or clinical utility of machine learning in some areas of neuroimaging.

Title: Simultaneous removal of tetracycline and copper ions from wastewater by flow-electrode capacitive deionization.
Year: 2023
Authors: Tong Peipei, Hang Zhenyu, Zhu Weihuang, Li Zhihua
Abstract: <b>ABSTRACT</b>To effectively solve the problem of tetracycline (TC) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> contamination in wastewater, this study innovatively proposed a low-energy flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) technology to simultaneously remove TC and Cu<sup>2+</sup> from wastewater. The removal efficiencies of TC and Cu<sup>2+</sup> using FCDI was investigated under various voltages, electrode flow rates, influent flow rates, and electrode liquid concentrations. The results showed that the removal efficiency of TC and Cu<sup>2+</sup> was 60.78% and 84.43%, respectively. The energy consumption for TC and Cu<sup>2+</sup> removal was only 1.76 and 1.10 kWh kg<sup>-1</sup>, which was lower than other electrochemical systems. The ion removal performance of the FCDI system remained stable after six cycles of continuous operation. These findings demonstrated the promising potential of FCDI as an innovative technology for the simultaneous removal of TC and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, presenting a significant prospects for application in the water treatment field.

Title: Data-driven development of an oral lipid-based nanoparticle formulation of a hydrophobic drug.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bao Zeqing, Yung Fion, Hickman Riley J, Aspuru-Guzik Alán, Bannigan Pauric, Allen Christine
Abstract: Due to its cost-effectiveness, convenience, and high patient adherence, oral drug administration normally remains the preferred approach. Yet, the effective delivery of hydrophobic drugs via the oral route is often hindered by their limited water solubility and first-pass metabolism. To mitigate these challenges, advanced delivery systems such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been developed to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and enhance their bioavailability. However, traditional design methodologies for these complex formulations often present intricate challenges because they are restricted to a relatively narrow design space. Here, we present a data-driven approach for the accelerated design of SLNs/NLCs encapsulating a model hydrophobic drug, cannabidiol, that combines experimental automation and machine learning. A small subset of formulations, comprising 10% of all formulations in the design space, was prepared in-house, leveraging miniaturized experimental automation to improve throughput and decrease the quantity of drug and materials required. Machine learning models were then trained on the data generated from these formulations and used to predict properties of all SLNs/NLCs within this design space (i.e., 1215 formulations). Notably, formulations predicted to be high-performers via this approach were confirmed to significantly enhance the solubility of the drug by up to 3000-fold and prevented degradation of drug. Moreover, the high-performance formulations significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of the drug compared to both its free form and an over-the-counter version. Furthermore, this bioavailability matched that of a formulation equivalent in composition to the FDA-approved product, Epidiolex<sup>®</sup>.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimedia technology and the massive accumulation of user data, a huge amount of data is rapidly generated and shared over the network, while the problems of inappropriate data access and abuse persist. Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) is a privacy-preserving method that embeds protected data in an encrypted domain and accurately extracts the embedded data without affecting the original content. However, the amount of embedded data has been one of the major limitations in the performance and application of RDHEI. Currently, the main approaches to improve the capacity of RDHEI are either to increase the overall capacity or to reduce the length of the auxiliary information. In this paper, we propose a novel RDHEI scheme based on multi-prediction and adaptive Huffman encoding. To increase the overall capacity, we propose a multi-prediction, called MED+GAP predictor, to generate the label map data of non-reference pixels prior to image encryption. Then, an adaptive Huffman coding is designed to compress the generated labels in order to reduce the embedding length of the auxiliary information used for the extraction and recovery. Experiments show that the proposed method with MED+GAP predictor and adaptive Huffman coding improves 0.052 bpp, 0.023 bpp, and 0.047 bpp on average over the other state-of-the-art methods on the BOSSBase, BOWS-2, and UCID datasets, respectively, while maintaining security and reversibility.

Title: [Current MR imaging of cartilage in the context of knee osteoarthritis (part 1) : Principles and sequences].
Year: 2023
Authors: Lemainque Teresa, Huppertz Marc Sebastian, Yüksel Can, Siepmann Robert, Kuhl Christiane, Roemer Frank, Truhn Daniel, Nebelung Sven
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clinical method of choice for cartilage imaging in the context of degenerative and nondegenerative joint diseases. The MRI-based definitions of osteoarthritis rely on the detection of osteophytes, cartilage pathologies, bone marrow edema and meniscal lesions but currently a scientific consensus is lacking. In the clinical routine proton density-weighted, fat-suppressed 2D turbo spin echo sequences with echo times of 30-40 ms are predominantly used, which are sufficiently sensitive and specific for the assessment of cartilage. The additionally acquired T1-weighted sequences are primarily used for evaluating other intra-articular and periarticular structures. Diagnostically relevant artifacts include magic angle and chemical shift artifacts, which can lead to artificial signal enhancement in cartilage or incorrect representations of the subchondral lamina and its thickness. Although scientifically validated, high-resolution 3D gradient echo sequences (for cartilage segmentation) and compositional MR sequences (for quantification of physical tissue parameters) are currently reserved for scientific research questions. The future integration of artificial intelligence techniques in areas such as image reconstruction (to reduce scan times while maintaining image quality), image analysis (for automated identification of cartilage defects), and image postprocessing (for automated segmentation of cartilage in terms of volume and thickness) will significantly improve the diagnostic workflow and advance the field further.

Title: Sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A comparative study and effects on communication skills.
Year: 2023
Authors: Berenguer Carmen, Baixauli Inmaculada, Rosa Eva, De Stasio Simona
Abstract: Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among children with neurodevelopmental disorders, like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hiperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The first objective of this study is to examine the differences in sleep problems between a group of children with ASD without intellectual disabilities, a group with ADHD and a typically developing (TD) group. A second objective is aimed at analyzing the effects of sleep problems and symptom severity on their communication skills. Participants were 122 children between 7 and 12 years old distributed in three groups: 32 TD children, 47 children with ASD and 43 children with ADHD, matched on age and intelligence. Parents completed different questionnaires that measured sleep disturbances and communication skills. Findings show significant differences between the clinical groups and the TD group in most types of sleep disorders. Moreover, the group with ADHD showed significantly more sleep breathing disorders and hyperhidrosis in comparison with ASD and TD, as well as more total sleep problems. In contrast to ASD, the predictive power of sleep problems on communication difficulties was greater in the group with ADHD. The results of the mediation analysis indicate that in both groups, sleep problems partially mediate the relationship between symptoms and communication. This investigation highlights the need of considering sleep disorders when assessing communication skills in ASD and ADHD, given its indirect influence in this domain. Understanding the sleep dysfunctions of both conditions and their repercussions is crucial to develop adjusted interventions.

Title: Behavioral Motor Performance.
Year: 2023
Authors: Leib Raz, Howard Ian S, Millard Matthew, Franklin David W
Abstract: The human sensorimotor control system has exceptional abilities to perform skillful actions. We easily switch between strenuous tasks that involve brute force, such as lifting a heavy sewing machine, and delicate movements such as threading a needle in the same machine. Using a structure with different control architectures, the motor system is capable of updating its ability to perform through our daily interaction with the fluctuating environment. However, there are issues that make this a difficult computational problem for the brain to solve. The brain needs to control a nonlinear, nonstationary neuromuscular system, with redundant and occasionally undesired degrees of freedom, in an uncertain environment using a body in which information transmission is subject to delays and noise. To gain insight into the mechanisms of motor control, here we survey movement laws and invariances that shape our everyday motion. We then examine the major solutions to each of these problems in the three parts of the sensorimotor control system, sensing, planning, and acting. We focus on how the sensory system, the control architectures, and the structure and operation of the muscles serve as complementary mechanisms to overcome deviations and disturbances to motor behavior and give rise to skillful motor performance. We conclude with possible future research directions based on suggested links between the operation of the sensorimotor system across the movement stages. © 2024 American Physiological Society.

Title: Machine learning algorithms in sepsis.
Year: 2024
Authors: Agnello Luisa, Vidali Matteo, Padoan Andrea, Lucis Riccardo, Mancini Alessio, Guerranti Roberto, Plebani Mario, Ciaccio Marcello, Carobene Anna
Abstract: Sepsis remains a significant global health challenge due to its high mortality and morbidity, compounded by the difficulty of early detection given its variable clinical manifestations. The integration of machine learning (ML) into laboratory medicine for timely sepsis identification and outcome forecasting is an emerging field of interest. This comprehensive review assesses the current body of research on ML applications for sepsis within the realm of laboratory diagnostics, detailing both their strengths and shortcomings. An extensive literature search was performed by two independent investigators across PubMed and Scopus databases, employing the keywords "Sepsis," "Machine Learning," and "Laboratory" without publication date limitations, culminating in January 2023. Each selected study was meticulously evaluated for various aspects, including its design, intent (diagnostic or prognostic), clinical environment, demographics, sepsis criteria, data gathering period, and the scope and nature of features, in addition to the ML methodologies and their validation procedures. Out of 135 articles reviewed, 39 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Among these, the majority (30 studies) were focused on devising ML algorithms for diagnosis, fewer (8 studies) on prognosis, and one study addressed both aspects. The dissemination of these studies across an array of journals reflects the interdisciplinary engagement in the development of ML algorithms for sepsis. This analysis highlights the promising role of ML in the early diagnosis of sepsis while drawing attention to the need for uniformity in validating models and defining features, crucial steps for ensuring the reliability and practicality of ML in clinical setting.

Title: Microbial degradation mechanism and pathway of the insecticide thiamethoxam by isolated Bacillus Cereus from activated sludge.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xiang Xuezhu, Xie Yue, Tian Di, Chen Zhenguo, Yi Xiaohui, Chen Ziyan, Huang Minzhi
Abstract: The high water solubility and ecotoxicity of thiamethoxam (TMX) is a potential hazard to ecosystems and human health. Here, a strain of Bacillus cereus with high TMX degradation activity was isolated from the sediment of the A<sup>2</sup>O process in the wastewater treatment plant and was able to utilize TMX as its sole carbon source. Under different environmental conditions, the degradation efficiency of TMX by Bacillus cereus-S1 (strain S1) ranged from 41.0% to 68.9% after 216 h. The optimum degradation conditions were DO = 3.5 mg/L and pH 9.0. The addition of an appropriate carbon-to-nitrogen ratio could accelerate the degradation of TMX. A plausible biodegradation pathway has been proposed based on the identified metabolites and their corresponding degradation pathways. TMX can be directly converted into Clothianidin (CLO), TMX-dm-hydroxyl and TMX-Urea by a series of reactions such as demethylation, oxadiazine ring cleavage and C=N substitution by hydroxy group. The main products were TMX-dm-hydroxyl and TMX-Urea, the amount of CLO production is relatively small. This study aims to provide a new approach for efficient degradation of TMX; furthermore, strain S1 is a promising biological source for in situ remediation of TMX contamination.

Title: Genotype-phenotype correlation in Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa: signposts to severity.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wen David, Hunjan Manrup, Bardhan Ajoy, Harper Natasha, Ogboli Malobi, Ozoemena Linda, Liu Lu, Fine Jo-David, Chapple Iain, Balacco Dario L, Heagerty Adrian
Abstract: Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis with a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Current genotype-phenotype paradigms are insufficient to accurately predict JEB subtype and characteristics from genotype, particularly for splice site mutations, which account for over a fifth of disease-causing mutations in JEB. This study evaluated genetic and clinical findings from a JEB cohort, investigating genotype-phenotype correlations through bioinformatic analyses and comparison with previously reported mutations. Eighteen unique mutations in LAMB3, LAMA3, LAMC2 or COL17A1 were identified from seventeen individuals. Seven had severe JEB, nine intermediate JEB and one laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome. Seven mutations were previously unreported. Deep phenotyping was completed for all intermediate JEB cases and demonstrated substantial variation between individuals. Splice site mutations underwent analysis with SpliceAI, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tool, in order to predict resultant transcripts. Predicted functional effects included exon skipping and cryptic splice site activation, which provided potential explanations for disease severity and in most cases correlated with lamimin-332 immunofluorescence. RT-PCR was performed for one case to investigate resultant transcripts produced from the splice site mutation. This study expands the JEB genomic and phenotypic landscape. AI tools show potential for predicting functional effects of splice site mutations and may identify candidates for confirmatory laboratory investigation. Investigation of RNA transcripts will help to further elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations for novel mutations.

Title: Principles of cognitive biology and the concept of biocivilisations.
Year: 2023
Authors: Slijepcevic Predrag
Abstract: A range of studies published in the last few decades promotes the cognitive aspects of life: all organisms, from bacteria to mammals, are capable of sensing/perception, decision-making, problem-solving, learning, and other cognitive functions, including sentience and consciousness. In this paper I present a scientific and philosophical synthesis of these studies, leading to an integrated view of cognitive biology. This view is expressed through the four principles applicable to all living systems: (1) sentience and consciousness, (2) autopoiesis, (3) free energy principle and relational biology, and (4) cognitive repertoire. The principles are circular, and they reinforce themselves. The circularity is not rigid, meaning that hierarchical and heterarchical shifts are widespread in the biosphere. The above principles emerged at the dawn of life, with the first cells, bacteria and archaea. All biogenic forms and functions that emerged since then can be traced to the first cells - indivisible units of biological agency. Following these principles, I developed the concept of biocivilisations to explain various forms of social intelligence in different kingdoms of life. The term biociviloisations draws on the human interpretation of the concept of civilisation, which searches for non-human equivalents of communication, engineering, science, medicine, art, and agriculture, in all kingdoms of life by applying the principles of cognitive biology. Potential avenues for testing the concept of biocivilisations are highlighted.

Title: A green strategy for upcycling utilization of core parts from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs): Pollution source analysis, technology flowchart, technology upgrade.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Rui, Zhan Lu, Xu Zhenming, Wang Ruixue, Wang Jianbo
Abstract: The disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) is an issue of great concern to the society, because of its huge amount, resource value and environmental pollution. A wide variety of pollutants generate and release during the recycling process. However, previous studies are piecemeal and segmentary, the correlation between treatment flowchart and pollution is unknown, and pollution source analysis in ELV recycling and core parts (engine, gear box, etc.) remanufacturing bases is still a challenge. In this study, the aim is to propose a green strategy for upcycling utilization of ELV part based on pollution source analysis, technology flowchart, and technology upgrade. We synthetically analyzed current typical ELV dismantling and core part remanufacturing processes of ELVs. A total of 36 volatile organic compound (VOC) species and 7 heavy metals were found in dismantling process, and 61 VOC species were detected in remanufacturing process. Based on statistical analysis and treatment process characteristics, 18 pollution fingerprints were constructed. At last, an intelligent dismantling and upcycle utilization line for ELVs has been developed to improve production efficiency and reduce pollution release.

Title: A new perspective in radon risk assessment: Mapping the geological hazard as a first step to define the collective radon risk exposure.
Year: 2023
Authors: Benà Eleonora, Ciotoli Giancarlo, Petermann Eric, Bossew Peter, Ruggiero Livio, Verdi Luca, Huber Paul, Mori Federico, Mazzoli Claudio, Sassi Raffaele
Abstract: Radon is a radioactive gas and a major source of ionizing radiation exposure for humans. Consequently, it can pose serious health threats when it accumulates in confined environments. In Europe, recent legislation has been adopted to address radon exposure in dwellings; this law establishes national reference levels and guidelines for defining Radon Priority Areas (RPAs). This study focuses on mapping the Geogenic Radon Potential (GRP) as a foundation for identifying RPAs and, consequently, assessing radon risk in indoor environments. Here, GRP is proposed as a hazard indicator, indicating the potential for radon to enter buildings from geological sources. Various approaches, including multivariate geospatial analysis and the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, have been utilised to generate continuous spatial maps of GRP based on point measurements. In this study, we employed a robust multivariate machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to create the GRP map of the central sector of the Pusteria Valley, incorporating other variables from census tracts such as land use as a vulnerability factor, and population as an exposure factor to create the risk map. The Pusteria Valley in northern Italy was chosen as the pilot site due to its well-known geological, structural, and geochemical features. The results indicate that high Rn risk areas are associated with high GRP values, as well as residential areas and high population density. Starting with the GRP map (e.g., Rn hazard), a new geological-based definition of the RPAs is proposed as fundamental tool for mapping Collective Radon Risk Areas in line with the main objective of European regulations, which is to differentiate them from Individual Risk Areas.

Title: Basin-wide tracking of nitrate cycling in Yangtze River through dual isotope and machine learning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xie Fazhi, Cai Gege, Li Guolian, Li Haibin, Chen Xing, Liu Yun, Zhang Wei, Zhang Jiamei, Zhao Xiaoli, Tang Zhi
Abstract: The nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) input has adversely affected the water quality and ecological function in the whole basin of the Yangtze River. The protection of water sources and implementation of "great protection of Yangtze River" policy require large-scale information on water contamination. In this study, dual isotope and Bayesian mixing model were used to research the transformation and sources of nitrate. Chemical fertilizers contribute 76 % of the nitrate sources in the upstream, while chemical fertilizers were also dominant in the midstream (39 %) and downstream (39 %) of Yangtze River. In addition, nitrification process occurred in the whole basin. Four machine learning models were used to relate nitrate concentrations to explanatory variables describing influence factors to predict nitrate concentrations in the whole basin of Yangtze River. The anthropogenic and natural factors, such as rainfall, GDP and population were chosen to take as predictor variables. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for nitrate has a better predictive performance with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.74. The predictive models of nitrate concentrations will help identify the nitrate distribution and transport in the whole Yangtze River basin. Overall, this study represents the first basin-wide data-driven assessment of the nitrate cycling in the Yangtze River basin.

Abstract: In recent decades, there have been significant advances in the diagnosis of diffuse gliomas, driven by the integration of novel technologies. These advancements have deepened our understanding of tumor oncogenesis, enabling a more refined stratification of the biological behavior of these neoplasms. This progress culminated in the fifth edition of the WHO classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in 2021. This comprehensive review article aims to elucidate these advances within a multidisciplinary framework, contextualized within the backdrop of the new classification. This article will explore morphologic pathology and molecular/genetics techniques (immunohistochemistry, genetic sequencing, and methylation profiling), which are pivotal in diagnosis, besides the correlation of structural neuroimaging radiophenotypes to pathology and genetics. It briefly reviews the usefulness of tractography and functional neuroimaging in surgical planning. Additionally, the article addresses the value of other functional imaging techniques such as perfusion MRI, spectroscopy, and nuclear medicine in distinguishing tumor progression from treatment-related changes. Furthermore, it discusses the advantages of evolving diagnostic techniques in classifying these tumors, as well as their limitations in terms of availability and utilization. Moreover, the expanding domains of data processing, artificial intelligence, radiomics, and radiogenomics hold great promise and may soon exert a substantial influence on glioma diagnosis. These innovative technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to these tumors. Ultimately, this review underscores the fundamental importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in employing recent diagnostic advancements, thereby hoping to translate them into improved quality of life and extended survival for glioma patients.

Title: A comparative study of a traditional localization algorithm and a deep learning model for radioactive particle tracking application.
Year: 2023
Authors: Dam Roos Sophia de Freitas, Affonso Renato Raoni Werneck, Salgado William Luna, Schirru Roberto, Salgado César Marques
Abstract: Radioactive particle tracking is a nuclear technique that tracks a sealed radioactive particle inside a volume through a mathematical location algorithm, which is widely applied in many fields such as chemical and civil engineering in hydrodynamics flows. It is possible to reconstruct the trajectory of the radioactive particle using a traditional mathematical algorithm or artificial intelligence methods. In this paper, the traditional algorithm is based on solving a minimization problem between the simulated events and a calibration dataset, and it was written using C++ language. The artificial intelligence method is represented by a deep neural network, in which hyperparameters were defined using a Python optimization library called Optuna. This paper aims to compare the potentiality of both methods to evaluate the accuracy of the radioactive particle tracking technique. This study proposes a simplified model of a concrete mixer, six NaI(Tl) detectors, and a<sup>137</sup>Cs sealed radioactive particle. The simulated measurement geometry and the dataset (3615 patterns) were developed using the MCNPX code, which is a mathematical code based on the Monte Carlo Method. The results show a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 20.81%, 10.33%, and 16.84% for x, y and z coordinates, respectively, for the traditional algorithm. For the deep neural network, MAPE is 6.87%, 2.70%, and 22.79% respectively for x, y and z coordinates. In addition, an investigation is carried out to analyze whether the size of the calibration dataset influences the performance of both methods.

Title: RVvictor: Virus RNA-directed molecular interactions for RNA virus infection.
Year: 2023
Authors: Amahong Kuerbannisha, Zhang Wei, Liu Yuhong, Li Teng, Huang Shijie, Han Lianyi, Tao Lin, Zhu Feng
Abstract: RNA viruses are major human pathogens that cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemic outbreaks. Due to the nature of their RNA genomes, it is anticipated that virus's RNA interacts with host protein (INTPRO), messenger RNA (INTmRNA), and non-coding RNA (INTncRNA) to perform their particular functions during their transcription and replication. In other words, thus, it is urgently needed to have such valuable data on virus RNA-directed molecular interactions (especially INTPROs), which are highly anticipated to attract broad research interests in the fields of RNA virus translation and replication. In this study, a new database was constructed to describe the virus RNA-directed interaction (INTPRO, INTmRNA, INTncRNA) for RNA virus (RVvictor). This database is unique in a) unambiguously characterizing the interactions between viruses RNAs and host proteins, b) providing, for the first time, the most systematic RNA-directed interaction data resources in providing clues to understand the molecular mechanisms of RNA viruses' translation, and replication, and c) in RVvictor, comprehensive enrichment analysis is conducted for each virus RNA based on its associated target genes/proteins, and the enrichment results were explicitly illustrated using various graphs. We found significant enrichment of a suite of pathways related to infection, translation, and replication, e.g., HIV infection, coronavirus disease, regulation of viral genome replication, and so on. Due to the devastating and persistent threat posed by the RNA virus, RVvictor constructed, for the first time, a possible network of cross-talk in RNA-directed interaction, which may ultimately explain the pathogenicity of RNA virus infection. The knowledge base might help develop new anti-viral therapeutic targets in the future. It's now free and publicly accessible at: https://idrblab.org/rvvictor/.

Title: Automatic data augmentation for medical image segmentation using Adaptive Sequence-length based Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xu Zhenghua, Wang Shengxin, Xu Gang, Liu Yunxin, Yu Miao, Zhang Hongwei, Lukasiewicz Thomas, Gu Junhua
Abstract: Although existing deep reinforcement learning-based approaches have achieved some success in image augmentation tasks, their effectiveness and adequacy for data augmentation in intelligent medical image analysis are still unsatisfactory. Therefore, we propose a novel Adaptive Sequence-length based Deep Reinforcement Learning (ASDRL) model for Automatic Data Augmentation (AutoAug) in intelligent medical image analysis. The improvements of ASDRL-AutoAug are two-fold: (i) To remedy the problem of some augmented images being invalid, we construct a more accurate reward function based on different variations of the augmentation trajectories. This reward function assesses the validity of each augmentation transformation more accurately by introducing different information about the validity of the augmented images. (ii) Then, to alleviate the problem of insufficient augmentation, we further propose a more intelligent automatic stopping mechanism (ASM). ASM feeds a stop signal to the agent automatically by judging the adequacy of image augmentation. This ensures that each transformation before stopping the augmentation can smoothly improve the model performance. Extensive experimental results on three medical image segmentation datasets show that (i) ASDRL-AutoAug greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art data augmentation methods in medical image segmentation tasks, (ii) the proposed improvements are both effective and essential for ASDRL-AutoAug to achieve superior performance, and the new reward evaluates the transformations more accurately than existing reward functions, and (iii) we also demonstrate that ASDRL-AutoAug is adaptive for different images in terms of sequence length, as well as generalizable across different segmentation models.

Title: Learning with limited annotations: A survey on deep semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiao Rushi, Zhang Yichi, Ding Le, Xue Bingsen, Zhang Jicong, Cai Rong, Jin Cheng
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and critical step in many image-guided clinical approaches. Recent success of deep learning-based segmentation methods usually relies on a large amount of labeled data, which is particularly difficult and costly to obtain, especially in the medical imaging domain where only experts can provide reliable and accurate annotations. Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an appealing strategy and been widely applied to medical image segmentation tasks to train deep models with limited annotations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods for medical image segmentation and summarize both the technical novelties and empirical results. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the limitations and several unsolved problems of existing approaches. We hope this review can inspire the research community to explore solutions to this challenge and further advance the field of medical image segmentation.

Title: Graph-guided deep hashing networks for similar patient retrieval.
Year: 2023
Authors: Gu Yifan, Yang Xuebing, Sun Mengxuan, Wang Chutong, Yang Hongyu, Yang Chao, Wang Jinwei, Kong Guilan, Lv Jicheng, Zhang Wensheng
Abstract: With the rapid growth and widespread application of electronic health records (EHRs), similar patient retrieval has become an important task for downstream clinical decision support such as diagnostic reference, treatment planning, etc. However, the high dimensionality, large volume, and heterogeneity of EHRs pose challenges to the efficient and accurate retrieval of patients with similar medical conditions to the current case. Several previous studies have attempted to alleviate these issues by using hash coding techniques, improving retrieval efficiency but merely exploring underlying characteristics among instances to preserve retrieval accuracy. In this paper, drug categories of instances recorded in EHRs are regarded as the ground truth to determine the pairwise similarity, and we consider the abundant semantic information within such multi-labels and propose a novel framework named Graph-guided Deep Hashing Networks (GDHN). To capture correlation dependencies among the multi-labels, we first construct a label graph where each node represents a drug category, then a graph convolution network (GCN) is employed to derive the multi-label embedding of each instance. Thus, we can utilize the learned multi-label embeddings to guide the patient hashing process to obtain more informative and discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two datasets, including a real-world dataset concerning IgA nephropathy from Peking University First Hospital, and a publicly available dataset from MIMIC-III, compared with traditional hashing methods and state-of-the-art deep hashing methods using three evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate that GDHN outperforms the competitors at different hash code lengths, validating the superiority of our proposal.

Title: In vivo visualization of tumor-associated macrophages re-education by photoacoustic/fluorescence dual-modal imaging with a metal-organic frames-based caspase-1 nanoreporter.
Year: 2023
Authors: Fan Zhijin, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Sun Tong, Zeng Fanchu, Huang Guojia, Liang Changhong, Nie Liming
Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are vital in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to immunosuppression and therapy tolerance. Despite their importance, the precise re-education of TAMs in vivo continues to present a formidable challenge. Moreover, the lack of real-time and efficient methods to comprehend the spatiotemporal kinetics of TAMs repolarization remains a significant hurdle, severely hampering the accurate assessment of treatment efficacy and prognosis. Herein, we designed a metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based Caspase-1 nanoreporter (MCNR) that can deliver a TLR7/8 agonist to the TAMs and track time-sensitive Caspase-1 activity as a direct method to monitor the initiation of immune reprogramming. This nanosystem exhibits excellent TAMs targeting ability, enhanced tumor accumulation, and stimuli-responsive behavior. By inducing the reprogramming of TAMs, they were able to enhance T-cell infiltration in tumor tissue, resulting in inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in mice model. Moreover, MCNR also serves as an activatable photoacoustic and fluorescent dual-mode imaging agent through Caspase-1-mediated specific enzyme digestion. This feature enables non-invasive and real-time antitumor immune activation monitoring. Overall, our findings indicate that MCNR has the potential to be a valuable tool for tumor immune microenvironment remodeling and noninvasive quantitative detection and real-time monitoring of TAMs repolarization to immunotherapy in the early stage.

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (RRAMs) has attracted significant interest for their potential applications in embedded storage and neuromorphic computing. Materials based on metal chalcogenides have emerged as promising candidates for the fulfilment of these requirements. Due to its ability to manipulate electronic states and control trap states through controlled compositional dynamics, metal chalcogenide RRAM has excellent non-volatile resistive memory properties. In the present we have synthesized ZnO-CdO hybrid nanocomposite by using hydrothermal method as an active layer. The Ag/C<sub>15</sub>ZO/Pt hybrid nanocomposite structure memristors showed electrical properties similar to biological synapses. The device exhibited remarkably stable resistive switching properties that have a low SET/RESET (0.41/-0.2) voltage, a high R<sub>ON/OFF</sub> ratio of approximately 10<sup>5</sup>, a high retention stability, excellent endurance reliability up to 10<sup>4</sup> cycles and multilevel device storage performance by controlling the compliance current. Furthermore, they exhibited an impressive performance in terms of emulating biological synaptic functions, which include long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), via the continuous modulation of conductance. The hybrid nanocomposite memristors notably achieved an impressive recognition accuracy of up to 92.6 % for handwritten digit recognition under artificial neural network (ANN). This study shows that hybrid-nanocomposite memristor performance could lead to efficient future neuromorphic architectures.

Title: Smartphone-integrated paper-based sensing platform for the visualization and quantitative detection of pymetrozine.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhao Beibei, Liu Xinfang, Cheng Zheng, Liu Xu, Zhang Xiaoyu, Feng Xun
Abstract: Pymetrozine (PYM) is an effective pyridine insecticide for controlling aphids, while its residues pose a serious threat to human health. Herein, a europium complex (Eu-DBPA, DBPA represents deprotonated 2,5-dibromoterephthalic acid ligand) probe was prepared for the detection of PYM via fluorescence quenching. The detection process has the advantages of short response time (2 min), wide linear range (0-4 and 4-45 mg/kg) and low detection limit (2.2 μg/kg). Furthermore, a portable detection platform was designed by integrating Eu-DBPA-based paper strip with smartphone and applied for the visual detection of PYM in real cucumber, tomato, cabbage and apple samples, obtaining satisfactory recovery (99.00 %-107.00 %) and low standard deviation (RSD < 3.4 %). In addition, a logic gate device was designed to simplify the detection process. The smartphone-integrated paper-based probe detection platform provides a new strategy for intelligent and online identification of hazards in environmental and biological samples.

Title: Inflammation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Libby Peter
Abstract: The notion that inflammation contributes to atherosclerosis has now gained considerable currency. Inflammation participates in atherosclerosis inception, progression, and thrombotic complications. Induced expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules and chemoattractant cytokines recruit blood cells to the arterial intima. Lesions can contain virtually every type of leukocyte. Monocytes mature into macrophages and imbibe lipids becoming foam cells, a hallmark of the atherosclerotic lesion. T lymphocytes can instruct the more numerous macrophages to express genes involved in the progression of the atheroma and its eventual destabilization. Inflammation is becoming clinically actionable to refine risk prediction, allocate treatments, and as a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Nuclear detection, segmentation and morphometric profiling are essential in helping us further understand the relationship between histology and patient outcome. To drive innovation in this area, we setup a community-wide challenge using the largest available dataset of its kind to assess nuclear segmentation and cellular composition. Our challenge, named CoNIC, stimulated the development of reproducible algorithms for cellular recognition with real-time result inspection on public leaderboards. We conducted an extensive post-challenge analysis based on the top-performing models using 1,658 whole-slide images of colon tissue. With around 700 million detected nuclei per model, associated features were used for dysplasia grading and survival analysis, where we demonstrated that the challenge's improvement over the previous state-of-the-art led to significant boosts in downstream performance. Our findings also suggest that eosinophils and neutrophils play an important role in the tumour microevironment. We release challenge models and WSI-level results to foster the development of further methods for biomarker discovery.

Title: Rapid laser fabrication of indium tin oxide and polymer-derived ceramic composite thin films for high-temperature sensors.

Abstract: Thin-film sensors are essential for real-time monitoring of components in high-temperature environments. Traditional fabrication methods often involve complicated fabrication steps or require prolonged high-temperature annealing, limiting their practical applicability. Here, we present an approach using direct ink writing and laser scanning (DIW-LS) to fabricate high-temperature functional thin films. An indium tin oxide (ITO)/preceramic polymer (PP) ink suitable for DIW was developed. Under LS, the ITO/PP thin film shrank in volume. Meanwhile, the rapid pyrolysis of PP into amorphous precursor-derived ceramic (PDC) facilitated the faster sintering of ITO nanoparticles and improved the densification of the thin film. This process realized the formation of a conductive network of interconnected ITO nanoparticles. The results show that the ITO/PDC thin film exhibits excellent stability, with a drift rate of 4.7 % at 1000 °C for 25 h, and withstands temperatures up to 1250 °C in the ambient atmosphere. It is also sensitive to strain, with a maximum gauge factor of -6.0. As a proof of concept, we have used DIW-LS technology to fabricate a thin-film heat flux sensor on the surface of the turbine blade, capable of measuring heat flux densities over 1 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. This DIW-LS process provides a viable approach for the integrated, rapid, and flexible fabrication of thin film sensors for harsh environments.

Title: Intensive vision-guided network for radiology report generation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zheng Fudan, Li Mengfei, Wang Ying, Yu Weijiang, Wang Ruixuan, Chen Zhiguang, Xiao Nong, Lu Yutong
Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is booming due to its huge application potential for the healthcare industry. However, existing computer vision and natural language processing approaches to tackle this problem are limited in two aspects. First, when extracting image features, most of them neglect multi-view reasoning in vision and model single-view structure of medical images, such as space-view or channel-view. However, clinicians rely on multi-view imaging information for comprehensive judgment in daily clinical diagnosis. Second, when generating reports, they overlook context reasoning with multi-modal information and focus on pure textual optimization utilizing retrieval-based methods. We aim to address these two issues by proposing a model that better simulates clinicians' perspectives and generates more accurate reports. &#xD;Approach. Given the above limitation in feature extraction, we propose a Globally-intensive Attention (GIA) module in the medical image encoder to simulate and integrate multi-view vision perception. GIA aims to learn three types of vision perception: depth view, space view, and pixel view. On the other hand, to address the above problem in report generation, we explore how to involve multi-modal signals to generate precisely matched reports, i.e., how to integrate previously predicted words with region-aware visual content in next word prediction. Specifically, we design a Visual Knowledge-guided Decoder (VKGD), which can adaptively consider how much the model needs to rely on visual information and previously predicted text to assist next word prediction. Hence, our final Intensive Vision-guided Network (IVGN) framework includes a GIA-guided Visual Encoder and the VKGD. &#xD;Main results. Experiments on two commonly-used datasets IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate the superior ability of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. &#xD;Significance. Our model explores the potential of simulating clinicians' perspectives and automatically generates more accurate reports, which promotes the exploration of medical automation and intelligence.

Title: Comparative Proteomics Inspired Self-Stimulated Release Hydrogel Reinforces the Therapeutic Effects of MSC-EVs on Alzheimer's Disease.
Year: 2023
Authors: Huang Meng, Zheng Mengna, Song Qingxiang, Ma Xinyi, Zhang Qian, Chen Huan, Jiang Gan, Zhou Songlei, Chen Hongzhuan, Wang Gang, Dai Chengxiang, Li Suke, Li Ping, Wang Hao, Zhang Ao, Huang Yukun, Chen Jun, Gao Xiaoling
Abstract: The clinical application of extracellular vesicles (EVs)-based therapeutics continues to be challenging due to their rapid clearance, restricted retention, and low yields. Although hydrogel possesses the ability to impede physiological clearance and increase regional retention, it typically fails to effectively release the incorporated EVs, resulting in reduced accessibility and bioavailability. Here an intelligent hydrogel in which the release of EVs is regulated by the proteins on the EVs membrane is proposed. By utilizing the EVs membrane enzyme to facilitate hydrogel degradation, sustained retention and self-stimulated EVs release can be achieved at the administration site. To achieve this goal, the membrane proteins with matrix degrading activity in the mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are identified using comparative proteomics. After that, a hydrogel comprised of self-assembled peptides that are susceptible to degradation by the membrane enzymes present in MSC-EVs is designed and synthesized. After intranasal administration, this peptide hydrogel facilitates sustained and thermo-sensitive release of MSC-EVs, thereby extending the retention of the MSC-EVs and substantially enhancing their potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. This research presents a comparative proteomics-driven approach to intelligent hydrogel design, which holds the capacity to significantly enhance the applicability of EVs in clinical settings.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood sugar control issues. The state-of-the-art solution is the artificial pancreas (AP), which integrates basal insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. However, APs are unable to manage postprandial glucose response (PGR) due to limited knowledge of its determinants, requiring additional information for accurate bolus delivery, such as estimated carbohydrate intake. This study aims to quantify the influence of various meal-related factors on predicting postprandial blood glucose levels (BGLs) at different time intervals (15 min, 60 min, and 120 min) after meals by using deep neural network (DNN) models. The prediction models incorporate preprandial blood glucose values, insulin dosage, and various meal-related nutritional factors such as intake of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fatty acids, fibers, glycemic index, and glycemic load as input variables. The impact of input features was assessed by exploiting eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provide insights into each feature's contribution to the model predictions. By leveraging XAI methodologies, this study aims to enhance the interpretability and transparency of BGL prediction models and validate clinical literature hypotheses. The findings can aid in the development of decision-support tools for individuals with T1DM, facilitating PGR management and reducing the risks of adverse events. The improved understanding of PGR determinants may lead to advancements in AP technology and improve the overall quality of life for T1DM patients.

Title: Is attention all you need in medical image analysis? A review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Papanastasiou Giorgos, Dikaios Nikolaos, Huang Jiahao, Wang Chengjia, Yang Guang
Abstract: Medical imaging is a key component in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical trial design, accounting for almost 90% of all healthcare data. CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on small-scale MI data. Despite their important advances, typical CNN have relatively limited capabilities in modelling "global" pixel interactions, which restricts their generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different "global" information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments ("Transf/Attention") which can well maintain properties for modelling global relationships, have been proposed as lighter alternatives of full Transformers. Recently, there is an increasing trend to co-pollinate complementary local-global properties from CNN and Transf/Attention architectures, which led to a new era of hybrid models. The past years have witnessed substantial growth in hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models across diverse MIA problems. In this systematic review, we survey existing hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, review and unravel key architectural designs, analyse breakthroughs, and evaluate current and future opportunities as well as challenges. We also introduced an analysis framework on generalisation opportunities of scientific and clinical impact, based on which new data-driven domain generalisation and adaptation methods can be stimulated.

Abstract: Identifying the state-related "neural correlates of consciousness" for anesthetics-induced unconsciousness is challenging. Spatiotemporal complexity is a promising tool for investigating consciousness. We hypothesized that spatiotemporal complexity may serve as a state-related but not drug-related EEG indicator during an unconscious state induced by different anesthetic drugs (e.g., propofol and esketamine).

Title: Anatomical substrates of Rapid Eye Movement sleep rebound in a rodent model of post-sevoflurane sleep disruption.

Abstract: Previous research suggests that sevoflurane anesthesia may prevent the brain from accessing REM sleep. If true, then patterns of neural activity observed in REM-on and REM-off neuronal populations during recovery from sevoflurane should resemble those seen after REM sleep deprivation. In this study we hypothesized that, relative to controls, animals exposed to sevoflurane present with a distinct expression pattern of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in a cluster of nuclei classically associated with REM sleep, and that such expression in sevoflurane -exposed and REM sleep-deprived animals is largely similar.

Title: Simulation and analysis of hydraulic transition process based on mechanical hydraulics.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chen Chaoyu, Zhan Qingbiao
Abstract: With the scarcity of water resources in various regions, the pressure on water supply projects is also increasing, which has led to a sharp increase in the water hammer effect in water supply pump projects. In response to this issue, the study proposes to apply a unidirectional pressure regulating tower based on mechanical hydraulic technology to water hammer protection in water supply pumps. In addition, the study also optimizes the calculation method of water hammer and designs one simulation software, which is used to simulate and analyze the proposed water hammer protection measures. The study first determines through simulation software that the optimal initial water level of the unidirectional pressure regulating tower is 2m and the optimal diameter of the make-up water pipe is 600 mm. Afterwards, simulation analysis is conducted on different water hammer protection measures, and it is found that the maximum pressure of the water hammer under the proposed protection measures is the lowest, at 14.8m, which was lower than the comparison measures. In addition, according to expert ratings, the average protective effect rating of protective measure 1 by relevant technical personnel is 9.4 points, which is better than the comparative measure. The above results indicate that through the simulation analysis of hydraulic transition process based on mechanical hydraulics, it can be found that the water hammer protection measures proposed in the study have good protective functions and can effectively reduce the water hammer effect in water supply engineering.

Title: Spectroscopy-Guided Deep Learning Predicts Solid-Liquid Surface Adsorbate Properties in Unseen Solvents.
Year: 2024
Authors: Du Wenjie, Ma Fenfen, Zhang Baicheng, Zhang Jiahui, Wu Di, Sharman Edward, Jiang Jun, Wang Yang
Abstract: Accurately and rapidly acquiring the microscopic properties of a material is crucial for catalysis and electrochemistry. Characterization tools, such as spectroscopy, can be a valuable tool to infer these properties, and when combined with machine learning tools, they can theoretically achieve fast and accurate prediction results. However, on the path to practical applications, training a reliable machine learning model is faced with the challenge of uneven data distribution in a vast array of non-negligible solvent types. Herein, we employ a combination of the first-principles-based approach and data-driven model. Specifically, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) to calculate theoretical spectral data of CO-Ag adsorption in 23 different solvent systems as a data source. Subsequently, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction multiexpert neural network (HMNN) to bridge the knowledge gaps among different solvent systems. HMNN undergoes two training tiers: in tier I, it learns fundamental quantitative spectra-property relationships (QSPRs), and in tier II, it inherits the fundamental QSPR knowledge from previous steps through a dynamic integration of expert modules and subsequently captures the solvent differences. The results demonstrate HMNN's superiority in estimating a range of molecular adsorbate properties, with an error range of less than 0.008 eV for zero-shot predictions on unseen solvents. The findings underscore the usability, reliability, and convenience of HMNN and could pave the way for real-time access to microscopic properties by exploiting QSPR.

Abstract: Label-free data mining can efficiently feed large amounts of data from the vast scientific literature into artificial intelligence (AI) processing systems. Here, we demonstrate an unsupervised syntactic distance analysis (SDA) approach that is capable of mining chemical substances, functions, properties, and operations without annotation. This SDA approach was evaluated in several areas of research from the physical sciences and achieved performance in information mining comparable to that of supervised learning, as shown by its satisfactory scores of 0.62-0.72, 0.60-0.82, and 0.86-0.95 in precision, recall, and accuracy, respectively. We also showcase how our approach can assist robotic chemists programmed to perform research focused on double-perovskite colloidal nanocrystals, gold colloidal nanocrystals, oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, and enzyme-like catalysts by designing materials, formulations, and synthesis parameters based on data mined from 1.1 million literature references.

Abstract: The exponential growth of bioinformatics tools in recent years has posed challenges for scientists in selecting the most suitable one for their data analysis assignments. Therefore, to aid scientists in making informed choices, a community-based platform that indexes and rates bioinformatics tools is urgently needed. In this study, we introduce BioTreasury ( http://biotreasury.rjmart.cn ), an integrated community-based repository that provides an interactive platform for users and developers to share their experiences in various bioinformatics tools. BioTreasury offers a comprehensive collection of well-indexed bioinformatics software, tools, and databases, totaling over 10,000 entries. In the past two years, we have continuously improved and maintained BioTreasury, adding several exciting features, including creating structured homepages for every tool and user, a hierarchical category of bioinformatics tools and classifying tools using large language model (LLM). BioTreasury streamlines the tool submission process with intelligent auto-completion. Additionally, BioTreasury provides a wide range of social features, for example, enabling users to participate in interactive discussions, rate tools, build and share tool collections for the public. We believe BioTreasury can be a valuable resource and knowledge-sharing platform for the biomedical community. It empowers researchers to effectively discover and evaluate bioinformatics tools, fostering collaboration and advancing bioinformatics research.

Title: Neuropsychological performances, quality of life, and psychological issues in pediatric onset multiple sclerosis: a narrative review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Tarantino Samuela, Proietti Checchi Martina, Papetti Laura, Monte Gabriele, Ferilli Michela Ada Noris, Valeriani Massimiliano
Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily a disease diagnosed in young and middle-aged adults. Although MS is a rare condition in pediatric age, an increasing rate of patients is diagnosed under the age of 18. The disabling nature of the disease cannot be reduced only to physical symptoms. Several additional symptoms such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, and psychological symptoms are common features of pediatric MS. The reviewed literature suggests that, despite the lower physical disability, children and adolescents diagnosed with MS are vulnerable to cognitive impairment even in the early stage of the disease. The neuropsychological profile of pediatric MS may resemble that of adult MS, including an impairment in attention/information processing speed, learning, verbal, and visuospatial memory. However, cognitive difficulties in children and adolescents are more likely to involve also general intelligence and linguistic abilities, presumably due to patients' younger age and cognitive growth stage. Cognitive difficulties, beyond physical disability and relapses, may have a considerable impact on learning and school achievement. Depression and fatigue are other highly prevalent disturbances in pediatric MS and may contribute to patients' low functional outcomes. Overall, these manifestations may cause considerable functional impairment on daily activities and quality of life that may require individualized rehabilitative treatment and extensive psychosocial care. Additional neuropsychological research evaluating larger samples, using more homogenous methods, and exploring the role of MS treatment on cognitive and psychological development is required.

Title: Nanomaterials-Based Field-Effect Transistor for Protein Sensing: New Advances.
Year: 2023
Authors: Aftab Sikandar, Li Xin, Hussain Sajjad, Aslam Muhammad, Hegazy Hosameldin Helmy, Abd-Rabboh Hisham S M, Koyyada Ganesh, Kim Jae Hong
Abstract: It is crucial for early stage medical diagnostics to identify disease biomarkers at ultralow concentrations. A wide range of analytes can be identified using low-dimensional materials to build highly sensitive, targeted, label-free, field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are preferable for high-performance biosensing because of their dramatic change in resistivity upon analyte adsorption or biomarker detection, tunable electronic properties, high surface activities, adequate stability, and layer-dependent semiconducting properties. We give a succinct overview of interesting applications for protein sensing with various architectural styles, such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)-based FETs that include carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (Gr), reduced graphene oxide (rGr), 2D transition-metal carbides (MXene), and Gr/MXene heterostructures. Because it might enable individuals to perform better, this review will be an important contribution to the field of medical science. These achievements demonstrate point-of-care diagnostics' abilities to detect biomarkers at ultrahigh performance levels. A summary of the present opportunities and challenges appears in the conclusion.

Title: Lighting up Lipidic Nanoflares with Self-Powered and Multivalent 3D DNA Rolling Motors for High-Efficiency MicroRNA Sensing in Serum and Living Cells.
Year: 2024
Authors: Li Chan, Xue Guohui, Wu Rong, Zhang Jing, Cheng Yinghao, Huang Guoqiao, Xu Huo, Song Qiufeng, Cheng Ruize, Shen Zhifa, Xue Chang
Abstract: Intelligent DNA nanomachines are powerful and versatile molecular tools for bioimaging and biodiagnostic applications; however, they are generally constrained by complicated synthetic processes and poor reaction efficiencies. In this study, we developed a simple and efficient molecular machine by coupling a self-powered rolling motor with a lipidic nanoflare (termed RMNF), enabling high-contrast, robust, and rapid probing of cancer-associated microRNA (miRNA) in serum and living cells. The lipidic nanoflare is a cholesterol-based lipidic micelle decorated with hairpin-shaped tracks that can be facilely synthesized by stirring in buffered solution, whereas the 3D rolling motor (3D RM) is a rigidified tetrahedral DNA scaffold equipped with four single-stranded "legs" each silenced by a locking strand. Once exposed to the target miRNA, the 3D RM can be activated, followed by self-powered precession based on catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and lighting up of the lipidic nanoflare. Notably, the multivalent 3D RM that moves using four DNA legs, which allows the motor to continuously and acceleratedly interreact with DNA tracks rather than dissociate from the surface of the nanoflare, yielded a limit of detection (LOD) of 500 fM at 37 °C within 1.5 h. Through the nick-hidden and rigidified structure design, RMNF exhibits high biostability and a low false-positive signal under complex physiological settings. The final application of RMNF for miRNA detection in clinical samples and living cells demonstrates its considerable potential for biomedical imaging and clinical diagnosis.

Title: Thermal damage map prediction during irreversible electroporation with U-Net.
Year: 2023
Authors: Khorasani Amir
Abstract: Recent developments in cancer treatment with irreversible electroporation (IRE) have led to a renewed interest in developing a treatment planning system based on Deep-Learning methods. This paper will give an account of U-Net, as a Deep-Learning architecture usage for predicting thermal damage area during IRE. In this study, an irregular shape of the liver tumor with MIMICS and 3-Matic software was created from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. To create electric field distribution and thermal damage maps in IRE, COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 finite element analysis was performed. It was decided to use the pair needle, single bipolar, and multi-tine electrodes with different geometrical parameters as electrodes. The U-Net was designed as a Deep-Learning network to train and predict the thermal damage area from electric field distribution in the IRE. The average DICE coefficient and accuracy of trained U-Net for predicting thermal damage area on test data sets were 0.96 and 0.98, respectively, for the dataset consisting of all electrode type electric field intensity images. This is the first time that U-Net has been used to predict thermal damage area. The results of this research support the idea that the U-Net can be used for predicting thermal damage areas during IRE as a treatment planning system.

Title: Toward hippocampal volume measures on ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging: a comprehensive comparison study between deep learning and conventional approaches.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lyu Junyan, Bartlett Perry F, Nasrallah Fatima A, Tang Xiaoying
Abstract: The hippocampus is a complex brain structure that plays an important role in various cognitive aspects such as memory, intelligence, executive function, and path integration. The volume of this highly plastic structure is identified as one of the most important biomarkers of specific neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been extensively investigated in numerous aging studies. However, recent studies on aging show that the performance of conventional approaches in measuring the hippocampal volume is still far from satisfactory, especially in terms of delivering longitudinal measures from ultra-high field magnetic resonance images (MRIs), which can visualize more boundary details. The advancement of deep learning provides an alternative solution to measuring the hippocampal volume. In this work, we comprehensively compared a deep learning pipeline based on nnU-Net with several conventional approaches including Freesurfer, FSL and DARTEL, for automatically delivering hippocampal volumes: (1) Firstly, we evaluated the segmentation accuracy and precision on a public dataset through cross-validation. Results showed that the deep learning pipeline had the lowest mean (<i>L</i> = 1.5%, <i>R</i> = 1.7%) and the lowest standard deviation (<i>L</i> = 5.2%, <i>R</i> = 6.2%) in terms of volume percentage error. (2) Secondly, sub-millimeter MRIs of a group of healthy adults with test-retest 3T and 7T sessions were used to extensively assess the test-retest reliability. Results showed that the deep learning pipeline achieved very high intraclass correlation coefficients (<i>L</i> = 0.990, <i>R</i> = 0.986 for 7T; <i>L</i> = 0.985, <i>R</i> = 0.983 for 3T) and very small volume percentage differences (<i>L</i> = 1.2%, <i>R</i> = 0.9% for 7T; <i>L</i> = 1.3%, <i>R</i> = 1.3% for 3T). (3) Thirdly, a Bayesian linear mixed effect model was constructed with respect to the hippocampal volumes of two healthy adult datasets with longitudinal 7T scans and one disease-related longitudinal dataset. It was found that the deep learning pipeline detected both the subtle and disease-related changes over time with high sensitivity as well as the mild differences across subjects. Comparison results from the aforementioned three aspects showed that the deep learning pipeline significantly outperformed the conventional approaches by large margins. Results also showed that the deep learning pipeline can better accommodate longitudinal analysis purposes.

Title: The Utility of Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis and Management of Pancreatic Cancer.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kumar Vikash, Gaddam Mrunanjali, Moustafa Amr, Iqbal Rabia, Gala Dhir, Shah Mili, Gayam Vijay Reddy, Bandaru Praneeth, Reddy Madhavi, Gadaputi Vinaya
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in the medical domain in recent years. AI, an expansive field comprising Machine Learning (ML) and, within it, Deep Learning (DL), seeks to emulate the intricate operations of the human brain. It examines vast amounts of data and plays a crucial role in decision-making, overcoming limitations related to human evaluation. DL utilizes complex algorithms to analyze data. ML and DL are subsets of AI that utilize hard statistical techniques that help machines consistently improve at tasks with experience. Pancreatic cancer is more common in developed countries and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Managing pancreatic cancer remains a challenge despite significant advancements in diagnosis and treatment. AI has secured an almost ubiquitous presence in the field of oncological workup and management, especially in gastroenterology malignancies. AI is particularly useful for various investigations of pancreatic carcinoma because it has specific radiological features that enable diagnostic procedures without the requirement of a histological study. However, interpreting and evaluating resulting images is not always simple since images vary as the disease progresses. Secondly, a number of factors may impact prognosis and response to the treatment process. Currently, AI models have been created for diagnosing, grading, staging, and predicting prognosis and treatment response. This review presents the most up-to-date knowledge on the use of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.

Title: Artificial Intelligence: A Reliable Tool to Detect the Elongation of the Styloid Process.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jeevitha S Jebarani, Kumar S Lokesh, Yadalam Pradeep Kumar
Abstract: Background Eagle's syndrome is characterized by the anomalous elongation of the styloid process. This condition is usually identified through the manual evaluation of orthopantomogram (OPG) images, which is time-consuming and can have interobserver variability. The application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is gaining importance and interest in recent years. The application of AI in detecting styloid process elongation is less explored, advocating for research in the same arena. Aim and objectives The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence in detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs and to compare the performance of the three different AI algorithms with that of the manual radiographic evaluation by the radiologist. Materials and methods A total of 400 digital OPGs were screened, and linear measurements of the styloid process length (ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Maryland, USA)) were done for the identification of styloid process elongation by a single calibrated observer to finally include a processed image dataset including 169 images of the elongated styloid process and 200 images of the normal styloid process. A machine learning approach was used to detect the styloid process elongation using the three different AI models: logistic regression, neural network, and Naïve Bayes algorithms in Orange software (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia). Performance evaluation was done using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) curve. Results Logistic regression and neural network algorithms depicted the highest accuracy of 100% with no false positives or false negatives, securing a score of 1.000 for all the metrics. However, the Naïve Bayes model demonstrated a fairly considerable accuracy, classifying 49 false positive images and 59 false negative images with an AUC (area under the curve) score of 78 %. Nevertheless, it performed better than random guessing. Conclusion Logistic regression and neural network algorithms accurately detected styloid process elongation similar to that of manual radiographic evaluation. The Naïve Bayes algorithm did not perform an accurate classification yet performed better than random guessing. AI holds a promising scope for its application in automatically detecting styloid process elongation in digital OPGs.

Abstract: Predicting the length of hospital stay for myasthenia gravis (MG) patients is challenging due to the complex pathogenesis, high clinical variability, and non-linear relationships between variables. Considering the management of MG during hospitalization, it is important to conduct a risk assessment to predict the length of hospital stay. The present study aimed to successfully predict the length of hospital stay for MG based on an expandable data mining technique, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Data from 196 MG patients' hospitalization were analyzed, and the MARS model was compared with classical multiple linear regression (MLR) and three other machine learning (ML) algorithms. The average hospital stay duration was 12.3 days. The MARS model, leveraging its ability to capture non-linearity, identified four significant factors: disease duration, age at admission, MGFA clinical classification, and daily prednisolone dose. Cut-off points and correlation curves were determined for these risk factors. The MARS model outperformed the MLR and the other ML methods (including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator MLR, classification and regression tree, and random forest) in assessing hospital stay length. This is the first study to utilize data mining methods to explore factors influencing hospital stay in patients with MG. The results highlight the effectiveness of the MARS model in identifying the cut-off points and correlation for risk factors associated with MG hospitalization. Furthermore, a MARS-based formula was developed as a practical tool to assist in the measurement of hospital stay, which can be feasibly supported as an extension of clinical risk assessment.

Title: SynCluster: Reaction Type Clustering and Recommendation Framework for Synthesis Planning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Tiantao, Cao Zheng, Huang Yuansheng, Wan Yue, Wu Jian, Hsieh Chang-Yu, Hou Tingjun, Kang Yu
Abstract: AI-assisted synthesis planning has emerged as a valuable tool in accelerating synthetic chemistry for the discovery of new drugs and materials. The template-free approach, which showcases superior generalization capabilities, is seen as the mainstream direction in this field. However, it remains unclear whether such an end-to-end approach can achieve problem-solving performance on par with experienced chemists without fully revealing insights into the chemical mechanisms involved. Moreover, there is a lack of unified and chemically inspired frameworks for improving multitask reaction predictions in this area. In this study, we have addressed these challenges by investigating the impact of fine-grained reaction-type labels on multiple downstream tasks and propose a novel framework named SynCluster. This framework incorporates unsupervised clustering cues into the baseline models and identifies plausible chemical subspaces which is compatible with multitask extensions and can serve as model-independent indicators to effectively enhance the performance of multiple downstream tasks. In retrosynthesis prediction, SynCluster achieves significant improvements of 4.1 and 11.0% in top-1 and top-10 prediction accuracy, respectively, compared to the baseline Molecular Transformer, and achieves a notable enhancement of 13.9% in top-10 accuracy when combined with Retroformer. By incorporating simplified molecular-input line-entry system augmentation, our framework achieves higher top-10 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art sequence-based retrosynthesis models and improves over the baseline on the diversity and validity of reactants. SynCluster also achieves 94.9% top-10 accuracy in forward synthesis prediction and 51.5% top-10 Maxfrag accuracy in reagent prediction. Overall, SynCluster provides a fresh perspective with chemical interpretability and reinforcement of domain knowledge in the synthesis design. It offers a promising solution for improving the accuracy and efficiency of AI-assisted synthesis planning and bridges the gap between template-free approaches and the problem-solving abilities of experienced chemists.

Abstract: In this study, we elucidate if synthetic contrast enhanced computed tomography images created from plain computed tomography images using deep neural networks could be used for screening, clinical diagnosis, and postoperative follow-up of small-diameter renal tumors. This retrospective, multicenter study included 155 patients (artificial intelligence training cohort [n = 99], validation cohort [n = 56]) who underwent surgery for small-diameter (≤40 mm) renal tumors, with the pathological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, during 2010-2020. We created a learned deep neural networks using pix2pix. We examined the quality of the synthetic enhanced computed tomography images created using this deep neural networks and compared them with real enhanced computed tomography images using the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation parameter. We assessed concordance rates between real and synthetic images and diagnoses according to 10 urologists by creating a receiver operating characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve. The synthetic computed tomography images were highly concordant with the real computed tomography images, regardless of the existence or morphology of the renal tumor. Regarding the concordance rate, a greater area under the curve was obtained with synthetic computed tomography (area under the curve = 0.892) than with only computed tomography (area under the curve = 0.720; p < 0.001). In conclusions, this study is the first to use deep neural networks to create a high-quality synthetic computed tomography image that was highly concordant with a real computed tomography image. Our synthetic computed tomography images could be used for urological diagnoses and clinical screening.

Title: Odorants Identified in Chinese Dry-Cured Ham Contribute to Salty Taste Enhancement.
Year: 2024
Authors: Chen Yan Ping, Wang Mengni, Fang Xiaolei, Liya A, Zhang Haihua, Blank Imre, Zhu Hanyue, Liu Yuan
Abstract: Jinhua dry-cured ham (JDH) is a traditional fermented Chinese meat product. We studied the dynamic sensory and emotional profiles of JDHs obtained by five preparation methods and the corresponding release of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during oral processing. The VOCs with salty taste enhancement abilities were screened based on the correlations of VOCs with salty flavor and concentration of Na and K ions with salty flavor. A trained sensory panel evaluated the saltiness enhancements of selected VOCs by using static and dynamic sensory methods. The results revealed that Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and selected VOCs were mainly released during 0-10 s of the chewing process. The release of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in JDH residue samples exhibited consistently decreasing trends, while in saliva, their concentrations increased. The VOCs showing a high correlation with Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> and salty flavor have saltiness enhancement abilities in both NaCl solutions and NaCl + MSG mixtures. Odor-induced saltiness was pronounced at low salt concentrations (0.2% NaCl). The investigation demonstrated 16 VOCs exhibiting saltiness enhancement abilities, including 4 pyrazines, 5 acids, 4 sulfur-containing compounds, and 3 other compounds. The sensory evaluation suggested pyrazines and sulfur-containing compounds as good saltiness enhancers. 2-Furfuryl mercaptan significantly enhanced the salty sensation in the NaCl + MSG solutions when compared with MSG alone (<i>p</i> < 0.05). This research provides evidence that certain odorants identified in JDHs exhibit salty-enhancing properties, indicating their potential for salt reduction at the industrial level.

Title: Electronic Structure Effect of PtCo Alloy with Adjustable Compositions for Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zheng Xingqun, Wang Bin, Ren Bingzhi, Wang Qingmei, Lu Shun
Abstract: Various efficient strategies have been developed to overcome the anodic electrocatalyst issue of methanol-based fuel cells owing to their complicated methanol electrooxidation mechanism. In this work, PtCo nanoparticles with adjustable compositions supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub><i>x</i></sub>/MWCNTs) through the adsorbing-coating-annealing-etching route were synthesized. Compared with the Pt/C catalyst, Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs exhibit better electrocatalytic MOR activity in both activity and durability. Notably, the electrochemical mass and specific activity of the as-prepared catalyst are 1.04 mA μg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub> and 2.18 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, which are higher than those of the Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the as-prepared sample revealed lower onset potential during the CO stripping test. Furthermore, the Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs possess a lower current density decrease rate in chronoamperometry and cyclic durability tests. The enhancement of activity and stability of Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs could be ascribed to their ordered morphological structure, the electronic interaction between MWCNTs and PtCo nanoparticles, and the suitable electronic structure effect between Pt/Co ratios. The concept of the catalyst design in this study offers a different guideline for constructing the novel methanol electrooxidation catalyst, which will accelerate the widespread fuel cell practical application.

Authors: Shakeel Choudhary Sobhan, Khan Saad Jawaid
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide the ability to effectively evaluate and analyze human skin and hair assessments. The aim of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of applying Machine Learning (ML) methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in order to evaluate hair and skin assessments. PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct were searched in order to retrieve research publications between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2020 using appropriate keywords such as "hair and skin analysis." Following accurate screening, 20 peer-reviewed publications were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. The analysis demonstrated that prevalent Machine Learning (ML) methods comprised of Support Vector Machine (SVM), <i>k</i>-nearest Neighbor, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANN's were observed to yield the highest accuracy of 95% followed by SVM generating 90%. These techniques were most commonly applied for drafting framework assessments such as that of Melanoma. Values of parameters such as Sensitivity, Specificity, and Area under the Curve (AUC) were extracted from the studies and with the help of comparisons, relevant inferences were also made. ANN's were observed to yield the highest sensitivity of 82.30% as well as a 96.90% specificity. Hence, with this systematic review, a summarization of the studies was drafted that encapsulated how Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed for the analysis and evaluation of hair and skin assessments.

Title: An exploration of knowledge-organizing technologies to advance transdisciplinary back pain research.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lotz Jeffrey C, Ropella Glen, Anderson Paul, Yang Qian, Hedderich Michael A, Bailey Jeannie, Hunt C Anthony
Abstract: Chronic low back pain (LBP) is influenced by a broad spectrum of patient-specific factors as codified in domains of the biopsychosocial model (BSM). Operationalizing the BSM into research and clinical care is challenging because most investigators work in silos that concentrate on only one or two BSM domains. Furthermore, the expanding, multidisciplinary nature of BSM research creates practical limitations as to how individual investigators integrate current data into their processes of generating impactful hypotheses. The rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence (AI) is providing new tools for organizing knowledge, but the practical aspects for how AI may advance LBP research and clinical are beginning to be explored. The goals of the work presented here are to: (1) explore the current capabilities of knowledge integration technologies (large language models (LLM), similarity graphs (SGs), and knowledge graphs (KGs)) to synthesize biomedical literature and depict multimodal relationships reflected in the BSM, and; (2) highlight limitations, implementation details, and future areas of research to improve performance. We demonstrate preliminary evidence that LLMs, like GPT-3, may be useful in helping scientists analyze and distinguish cLBP publications across multiple BSM domains and determine the degree to which the literature supports or contradicts emergent hypotheses. We show that SG representations and KGs enable exploring LBP's literature in novel ways, possibly providing, trans-disciplinary perspectives or insights that are currently difficult, if not infeasible to achieve. The SG approach is automated, simple, and inexpensive to execute, and thereby may be useful for early-phase literature and narrative explorations beyond one's areas of expertise. Likewise, we show that KGs can be constructed using automated pipelines, queried to provide semantic information, and analyzed to explore trans-domain linkages. The examples presented support the feasibility for LBP-tailored AI protocols to organize knowledge and support developing and refining trans-domain hypotheses.

Title: Highly Efficient Iron-Based Catalyst for Light-Driven Selective Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes.
Year: 2024
Authors: Ma Jun, Mao Xin, Hu Canyu, Wang Xinyu, Gong Wanbing, Liu Dong, Long Ran, Du Aijun, Zhao Huijun, Xiong Yujie
Abstract: Light-driven hydrogenation of nitro compounds to functionalized amines is of great importance yet a challenge for practical applications, which calls for the development of high-performance, nonprecious photocatalysts and efficient catalytic systems. Herein, we report a high-efficiency Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst via a sol-gel and subsequent pyrolysis strategy, which exhibits desirable photothermal hydrogenation performance of nitro compounds to functionalized amines with the excellent selectivity of >90% exceeding those of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous photocatalysts. Our experimental results and theoretical calculations for the first time reveal that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is the major active phase, and the strong metal-support interaction between Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and reducible TiO<sub>2</sub> further leads to performance improvement, taking advantage of the enhanced photothermal effect and the improved adsorption for the reactant and hydrazine hydrate. Notably, a variety of halonitrobenzenes and pharmaceutical intermediates can be completely converted to functionalized amines with high selectivities, even in gram-scale reactions. This work provides a new insight into the rational design of nonprecious photo/thermo-catalysts for other catalytic reactions.

Authors: Baxter Natalie B, Lin Ching-Heng, Wallace Beth I, Chen Jung-Sheng, Kuo Chang-Fu, Chung Kevin C
Abstract: One in five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rely on surgery to restore joint function. However, variable response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) complicates surgical planning, and it is difficult to predict which patients may ultimately require surgery. We used machine learning to develop predictive models for a) likelihood of undergoing an operation related to RA, b) which type of operation surgical patients undergo.

Title: Instantaneous CO<sub>2</sub> emission modelling for a Euro 6 start-stop vehicle based on portable emission measurement system data and artificial intelligence methods.
Year: 2023
Authors: Mądziel Maksymilian
Abstract: One of the increasingly common methods to counteract the increased fuel consumption of vehicles is start-stop technology. This paper introduces a methodology which presents the process of measuring and creating a computational model of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using artificial intelligence techniques for a vehicle equipped with start-stop technology. The method requires only measurement data of velocity, acceleration of vehicle, and gradient of road to predict the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>. In this paper, three methods of machine learning techniques were analyzed, while the best prediction results are shown by the gradient boosting method. For the developed models, the results were validated using the coefficient of determination, the mean squared error, and based on visual evaluation of residual and instantaneous emission plots and CO<sub>2</sub> emission maps. The developed models present a novel methodology and can be used for microscale environmental analysis.

Title: Auditing the inference processes of medical-image classifiers by leveraging generative AI and the expertise of physicians.
Year: 2023
Authors: DeGrave Alex J, Cai Zhuo Ran, Janizek Joseph D, Daneshjou Roxana, Lee Su-In
Abstract: The inferences of most machine-learning models powering medical artificial intelligence are difficult to interpret. Here we report a general framework for model auditing that combines insights from medical experts with a highly expressive form of explainable artificial intelligence. Specifically, we leveraged the expertise of dermatologists for the clinical task of differentiating melanomas from melanoma 'lookalikes' on the basis of dermoscopic and clinical images of the skin, and the power of generative models to render 'counterfactual' images to understand the 'reasoning' processes of five medical-image classifiers. By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance. The framework can be applied to any specialized medical domain to make the powerful inference processes of machine-learning models medically understandable.

Title: Dr. GAI: Significance of Generative AI in Plastic Surgery.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ray Partha Pratim
Abstract: In this letter to the editor, I offer a critique of the article titled "Consulting the Digital Doctor: Google Versus ChatGPT as Sources of Information on Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma and Breast Implant Illness." While acknowledging the authors' pioneering effort to compare informational outputs from Google and a generative AI (GAI)-ChatGPT, I raise concerns about the methodology, lack of rigorous validation, potential biases, and the overstatement of findings. The letter suggests that the authors' conclusions about the superiority of ChatGPT in providing high-quality medical information may be premature, given the limitations of the study design and the evolving nature of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.No Level Assigned This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which Evidence-Based Medicine rankings are applicable.

Title: Research on vehicle detection based on improved YOLOX_S.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Zhihai, Han Wenyu, Xu Hao, Gong Kesong, Zeng Qingliang, Zhao Xieguang
Abstract: Aiming at the problem of easy misdetection and omission of small targets of long-distance vehicles in detecting vehicles in traffic scenes, an improved YOLOX_S detection model is proposed. Firstly, the redundant part of the original YOLOX_S network structure is clipped using the model compression strategy, which improves the model inference speed while maintaining the detection accuracy; secondly, the Resunit_CA structure is constructed by incorporating the coordinate attention module in the residual structure, which reduces the loss of feature information and improves the attention to the small target features; thirdly, in order to obtain richer small target features, the PAFPN structure tail to add an adaptive feature fusion module, which improves the model detection accuracy; finally, the loss function is optimized in the decoupled head structure, and the Focal Loss loss function is used to alleviate the problem of uneven distribution of positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOX_S model, the improved model proposed in this paper achieves an average detection accuracy of 77.19% on this experimental dataset. However, the detection speed decreases to 29.73 fps, which is still a large room for improvement in detection in real-time. According to the visualization experimental results, it can be seen that the improved model effectively alleviates the problems of small-target missed detection and multi-target occlusion.

Title: Prevalence and risk estimates of Cryptosporidium oocysts infection associated with consumption of raw-eaten vegetables in Maiduguri metropolis LGAs, Northeast Nigeria.
Year: 2023
Authors: Saidu A S, Mohammed S, Adamu S G, Sadiq M A, Tijjani A O, Musa H I, Jajere S M, Goni M D, Muhammed A, Idriss M D
Abstract: Cryptosporidium is one of the most important protozoan parasitic pathogens, and it is a common cause of diarrhoea in humans, domestic animals, and wild vertebrates and has serious public health threats. A cross-sectional study was designed to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in raw-eaten vegetables in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere Local Government Areas (LGAs). A total of 400 samples were collected from four (4) different locations, namely Tashan Bama, Gomboru, and Monday Markets (n = 100), while fifty (n = 50) each from 202-Vegetable-Vendors and Unimaid Commercials. A total of 16 visits were conducted in all the sampling areas (twenty-five samples per visit). The Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected using the Modified Ziehl-Neelsen Staining Technique. The locations, sources, and types of raw-eaten vegetables were also assessed. The oocysts were confirmed (100×) as bright pink spherules. Data generated were analyzed using IBM-SPSS V23.0, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Out of the total samples (n = 400) analyzed, cabbage appeared to have the highest number of 10 (12.5%) of Cryptosporidium oocysts detected, while Tomato and garden egg had 9 (11.3%) and 1 (1.2%), respectively. There was a statistically significant association (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.5, P = 0.014) between the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in raw-eaten vegetables and vegetable types. Among the sources of the vegetables sampled, Alau had the highest number of Cryptosporidium oocysts, 15 (12.5%), followed by Kilari-Abdullahi and Zabarmari sources with 4 (10.0%) and 4 (5.0%), respectively. However, Jetete appeared to have the least number 2 (2.5%) of oocysts, and there was a statistically significant association (χ<sup>2</sup>= 10.4, P = 0.034) between the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and the sources of vegetables and fruits. The study concludes that the raw-eaten vegetables sampled from Maiduguri Metropolis were contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocysts. The study recommends that all raw-eaten vegetables should be from cleaned sources and washed before consumption. Consumers should be enlightened on the hygienic measures in the food chain in line with the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles.

Title: Quantitative gait analysis and prediction using artificial intelligence for patients with gait disorders.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ben Chaabane Nawel, Conze Pierre-Henri, Lempereur Mathieu, Quellec Gwenolé, Rémy-Néris Olivier, Brochard Sylvain, Cochener Béatrice, Lamard Mathieu
Abstract: Quantitative Gait Analysis (QGA) is considered as an objective measure of gait performance. In this study, we aim at designing an artificial intelligence that can efficiently predict the progression of gait quality using kinematic data obtained from QGA. For this purpose, a gait database collected from 734 patients with gait disorders is used. As the patient walks, kinematic data is collected during the gait session. This data is processed to generate the Gait Profile Score (GPS) for each gait cycle. Tracking potential GPS variations enables detecting changes in gait quality. In this regard, our work is driven by predicting such future variations. Two approaches were considered: signal-based and image-based. The signal-based one uses raw gait cycles, while the image-based one employs a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D FFT) representation of gait cycles. Several architectures were developed, and the obtained Area Under the Curve (AUC) was above 0.72 for both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to apply neural networks for gait prediction tasks.

Title: Facts in counterfactuals-cognitive representations of Chinese counterfactuals.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ren Yufei, Cui Gang, Christie Stella
Abstract: How do people represent counterfactuals? As languages differ in expressibility of counterfactuals-some languages employ explicit grammatical marking for counterfactuals while others do not-are some speakers' representations of counterfactuals less explicit? Prior studies examining this question with Chinese speakers-a language devoid of explicit counterfactual markings-found mixed results. Here we re-examined the issue by using a more sensitive test: people's sensitivity to detect anomalies in sentences. We asked Chinese speakers to rate the acceptability of sentences employing "ruguo (if)…jiu (then)" configuration-the typical but non-unique, non-explicit marking of counterfactuals. Critically, we varied the semantic adherence to real-world facts [factuality], with some sentences containing made-up conditions [-fact as in "If fish had legs, then…"] versus real facts [+ fact: "If dogs had legs, then…"]. If speakers represent counterfactuals clearly, they should give higher acceptability ratings to [- facts] than to [+ facts] sentences, because the ostensible point of counterfactuals is to express non-factual situations. That is, expressing a true fact under a syntactic counterfactual construction makes the sentence anomalous. Instead, we found that Chinese speakers gave the opposite ratings: factual "if…then" sentences were rated as more acceptable than non-factual ones. This suggests that Chinese speakers find the processing of counterfactuals to be more challenging than processing facts, and that their representation of counterfactuals may be less explicit. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the link between linguistic markings and cognitive representations.

Title: Neuroimaging and artificial intelligence for assessment of chronic painful temporomandibular disorders-a comprehensive review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shrivastava Mayank, Ye Liang
Abstract: Chronic Painful Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) are challenging to diagnose and manage due to their complexity and lack of understanding of brain mechanism. In the past few decades' neural mechanisms of pain regulation and perception have been clarified by neuroimaging research. Advances in the neuroimaging have bridged the gap between brain activity and the subjective experience of pain. Neuroimaging has also made strides toward separating the neural mechanisms underlying the chronic painful TMD. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors by automating tasks that previously required humans' intelligence to complete. AI has started to contribute to the recognition, assessment, and understanding of painful TMD. The application of AI and neuroimaging in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of chronic painful TMD are still in its early stages. The objective of the present review is to identify the contemporary neuroimaging approaches such as structural, functional, and molecular techniques that have been used to investigate the brain of chronic painful TMD individuals. Furthermore, this review guides practitioners on relevant aspects of AI and how AI and neuroimaging methods can revolutionize our understanding on the mechanisms of painful TMD and aid in both diagnosis and management to enhance patient outcomes.

Abstract: Rapid population ageing and associated health issues such as frailty are a growing public health concern. While early identification and management of frailty may limit adverse health outcomes, the complex presentations of frailty pose challenges for clinicians. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to support the early identification and management of frailty. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of current evidence regarding the development and use of AI technologies including machine learning and deep learning for the identification and management of frailty, this protocol outlines a scoping review aiming to identify and present available information in this area. Specifically, this protocol describes a review that will focus on the clinical tools and frameworks used to assess frailty, the outcomes that have been evaluated and the involvement of knowledge users in the development, implementation and evaluation of AI methods and tools for frailty care in clinical settings.

Title: Endometrial Pipelle biopsy computer-aided diagnosis (ENDO-AID): a feasibility study.

Abstract: Endometrial biopsies are important in the diagnostic work-up of women who present with abnormal uterine bleeding or women with hereditary risk of endometrial cancer. In general, about 10% of all endometrial biopsies demonstrate endometrial (pre)malignancy that requires specific treatment. As the diagnostic evaluation of mostly benign cases results in a substantial workload for pathologists, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted pre-selection of biopsies could optimize the workflow. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of AI-assisted diagnosis for endometrial biopsies (ENDO-AID), trained on daily-practice whole slide images instead of highly selected images. Endometrial biopsies were classified into six clinically relevant categories defined as: non-representative, normal, non-neoplastic, hyperplasia without atypia, hyperplasia with atypia and malignant. The agreement among 15 pathologists, within these classifications, was evaluated in 91 endometrial biopsies. Next, an algorithm (trained on a total of 2,819 endometrial biopsies) rated the same 91 cases and we compared its performance using the pathologist's classification as reference standard. The interrater reliability among pathologists was moderate with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.51, whereas for a binary classification into benign versus (pre)malignant, the agreement was substantial with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.66. The AI algorithm performed slightly worse for the six categories with a moderate Cohen's kappa of 0.43, but was comparable for the binary classification with a substantial Cohen's kappa of 0.65. AI-assisted diagnosis of endometrial biopsies was demonstrated to be feasible in discriminating between benign and (pre)malignant endometrial tissue, even when trained on unselected cases. Endometrial premalignancies remain challenging for both pathologists and AI algorithms. Future steps to improve reliability of the diagnosis are needed to achieve a more refined AI-assisted diagnostic solution for endometrial biopsies that covers both premalignant and malignant diagnoses.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated exceptional performance in mitosis identification and quantification. However, the implementation of AI in clinical practice needs to be evaluated against the existing methods. This study is aimed at assessing the optimal method of using AI-based mitotic figure scoring in breast cancer (BC). We utilized whole slide images (WSIs) from a large cohort of BC with extended follow-up comprising a discovery (n=1715) and a validation (n=859) set (Nottingham cohort). The TCGA-BRCA cohort (n=757) was used as an external test set. Employing automated mitosis detection, the mitotic count was assessed using three different methods, the mitotic count per tumor area (MCT; calculated by dividing the number of mitotic figures by the total tumor area), the mitotic index (MI; defined as the average number of mitotic figures per 1000 malignant cells), and the mitotic activity index (MAI; defined as the number of mitotic figures in 3mm<sup>2</sup> area within the mitotic hotspot). These automated metrics were evaluated and compared based on their correlation with the well-established visual scoring method of the Nottingham grading system (NGS) as well as Ki67 score, clinicopathological parameters, and patient outcome. AI-based mitotic scores derived from the three methods (MCT, MI and MAI) were significantly correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics and patient's survival (p<0.001). However, the mitotic counts and the derived cut-offs varied significantly between the 3 methods. Only MAI and MCT were positively correlated with the gold standard visual scoring method used in NGS (r=0.8 and r=0.7 respectively), as well as Ki67 score (r=0.69 and r=0.55 respectively) and MAI was the only independent predictor of survival (p<0.05) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. For clinical applications, the optimum method of scoring mitosis using AI needs to be considered. MAI can provide reliable and reproducible results and can accurately quantify mitotic figures in BC.

Title: When does "no" mean no? Insights from sex robots.
Year: 2023
Authors: Grigoreva Anastasiia D, Rottman Joshua, Tasimi Arber
Abstract: Although sexual assault is widely accepted as morally wrong, not all instances of sexual assault are evaluated in the same way. Here, we ask whether different characteristics of victims affect people's moral evaluations of sexual assault perpetrators, and if so, how. We focus on sex robots (i.e., artificially intelligent humanoid social robots designed for sexual gratification) as victims in the present studies because they serve as a clean canvas onto which we can paint different human-like attributes to probe people's moral intuitions regarding sensitive topics. Across four pre-registered experiments conducted with American adults on Prolific (N = 2104), we asked people to evaluate the wrongness of sexual assault against AI-powered robots. People's moral judgments were influenced by the victim's mental capacities (Studies 1 & 2), the victim's interpersonal function (Study 3), the victim's ontological type (Study 4), and the transactional context of the human-robot relationship (Study 4). Overall, by investigating moral reasoning about transgressions against AI robots, we were able to gain unique insights into how people's moral judgments about sexual transgressions can be influenced by victim attributes.

Title: The untold story of PFAS alternatives: Insights into the occurrence, ecotoxicological impacts, and removal strategies in the aquatic environment.
Year: 2023
Authors: Hamid Naima, Junaid Muhammad, Sultan Marriya, Yoganandham Suman Thodhal, Chuan Ong Meng
Abstract: Due to increasing regulations on the production and consumption of legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the global use of PFAS substitutes increased tremendously, posing serious environmental risks owing to their bioaccumulation, toxicity, and lack of removal strategies. This review summarized the spatial distribution of alternative PFAS and their ecological risks in global freshwater and marine ecosystems. Further, toxicological effects of novel PFAS in various freshwater and marine species were highlighted. Moreover, degradation mechanisms for alternative PFAS removal from aquatic environments were compared and discussed. The spatial distribution showed that 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 CI-PFAES, also known as F-53B) was the most dominant emerging PFAS found in freshwater. Additionally, the highest levels of PFBS and PFBA were observed in marine waters (West Pacific Ocean). Moreover, short-chain PFAS exhibited higher concentrations than long-chain congeners. The ecological risk quotients (RQs) for phytoplankton were relatively higher >1 than invertebrates, indicating a higher risk for freshwater phytoplankton species. Similarly, in marine water, the majority of PFAS substitutes exhibited negligible risk for invertebrates and fish, and posed elevated risks for phytoplanktons. Reviewed studies showed that alternative PFAS undergo bioaccumulation and cause deleterious effects such as oxidative stress, hepatoxicity, neurotoxicity, histopathological alterations, behavioral and growth abnormalities, reproductive toxicity and metabolism defects in freshwater and marine species. Regarding PFAS treatment methods, photodegradation, photocatalysis, and adsorption showed promising degradation approaches with efficiencies as high as 90%. Finally, research gaps and future perspectives for alternative PFAS toxicological implications and their removal were offered.

Title: Increase metabolic heat to compensate for low temperature in activated sludge systems.
Year: 2023
Authors: Li Zhi-Hua, Yang Jia-Wei, Zhang Hao
Abstract: The efficient operation of activated sludge systems is frequently hindered by low temperatures, and extensive research has been conducted to overcome this difficulty. However, the effect of varying temperatures on heat generation during substrate degradation remains unclear. In this study, results from laboratory-scale reactors show that sludge generated 5.36 ± 0.58 J/mg COD, 4.45 ± 0.24 J/mg COD, and 4.22 ± 0.26 J/mg COD at 10 °C, 20 °C, and 30 °C under aerobic conditions, respectively. Similarly, the sludge generated 4.05 ± 0.31 J/mg COD, 2.37 ± 0.15 J/mg COD, and 2.89 ± 0.18 J/mg COD under anoxic conditions. Despite the decreased respiration rates and hence reduced pollutant removal efficiency, sludge exhibited effective heat generation at low temperatures. Results from the full-scale plant also show a negative correlation between the heat generation capacity of microorganisms and the temperatures. 14.2 °C is considered the critical wastewater temperature for microorganisms' heat generation to offset the investigated plant's heat dissipation. This observation verified that thermal compensation for low temperatures was also significant in the full-scale plant. The mechanism of low-temperature compensation is attributed to non-growth processes being less dependent on temperature than growth processes, resulting in slow microbial growth but high heat generation at low temperatures. These findings provide valuable insights into the design and sustainable operation of wastewater treatment plants.

Title: Self-supervised tumor segmentation and prognosis prediction in osteosarcoma using multiparametric MRI and clinical characteristics.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhou Zhixun, Xie Peng, Dai Zhehao, Wu Jia
Abstract: Osteosarcoma has a high mortality among malignant bone tumors. MRI-based tumor segmentation and prognosis prediction are helpful to assist doctors in detecting osteosarcoma, evaluating the patient's status, and improving patient survival. Current intelligent diagnostic approaches focus on segmentation with single-parameter MRI, which ignores the nature of MRI resulting in poor performance, and lacks the connection with prognosis prediction. Besides, osteosarcoma is a rare disease, and their few labeled data may lead to model overfitting.

Title: A method to improve the prediction performance of cancer-gene association by screening negative training samples through gene network data.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xu Mingzhe, Abdullah Nor Aniza, Md Sabri Aznul Qalid
Abstract: This work focuses on data sampling in cancer-gene association prediction. Currently, researchers are using machine learning methods to predict genes that are more likely to produce cancer-causing mutations. To improve the performance of machine learning models, methods have been proposed, one of which is to improve the quality of the training data. Existing methods focus mainly on positive data, i.e. cancer driver genes, for screening selection. This paper proposes a low-cancer-related gene screening method based on gene network and graph theory algorithms to improve the negative samples selection. Genetic data with low cancer correlation is used as negative training samples. After experimental verification, using the negative samples screened by this method to train the cancer gene classification model can improve prediction performance. The biggest advantage of this method is that it can be easily combined with other methods that focus on enhancing the quality of positive training samples. It has been demonstrated that significant improvement is achieved by combining this method with three state-of-the-arts cancer gene prediction methods.

Title: Characterization of lamb shashliks with different roasting methods by intelligent sensory technologies and GC-MS to simulate human muti-sensation: Based on multimodal deep learning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shen Che, Cai Guanhua, Tian Jiaqi, Wu Xinnan, Ding Meiqi, Wang Bo, Liu Dengyong
Abstract: To simulate the functions of olfaction, gustation, vision, and oral touch, intelligent sensory technologies have been developed. Headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) with electronic noses (E-noses), electronic tongues (E-tongues), computer vision (CVs), and texture analyzers (TAs) was applied for sensory characterization of lamb shashliks (LSs) with various roasting methods. A total of 56 VOCs in lamb shashliks with five roasting methods were identified by HS-SPME/GC-MS, and 21 VOCs were identified as key compounds based on OAV (>1). Cross-channel sensory Transformer (CCST) was also proposed and used to predict 19 sensory attributes and their lamb shashlik scores with different roasting methods. The model achieved satisfactory results in the prediction set (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.964). This study shows that a multimodal deep learning model can be used to simulate assessor, and it is feasible to guide and correct sensory evaluation.

Title: Research progress in nano-drug delivery systems based on the characteristics of the liver cancer microenvironment.
Year: 2024
Authors: Lu Shijia, Zhang Chenxiao, Wang Jinglong, Zhao Limei, Li Guofei
Abstract: The liver cancer has microenvironmental features such as low pH, M2 tumor-associated macrophage enrichment, low oxygen, rich blood supply and susceptibility to hematotropic metastasis, high chemokine expression, enzyme overexpression, high redox level, and strong immunosuppression, which not only promotes the progression of the disease, but also seriously affects the clinical effectiveness of traditional therapeutic approaches. However, nanotechnology, due to its unique advantages of size effect and functionalized modifiability, can be utilized to develop various responsive nano-drug delivery system (NDDS) by using these characteristic signals of the liver cancer microenvironment as a source of stimulation, which in turn can realize the intelligent release of the drug under the specific microenvironment, and significantly increase the concentration of the drug at the target site. Therefore, researchers have designed a series of stimuli-responsive NDDS based on the characteristics of the liver cancer microenvironment, such as hypoxia, weak acidity, and abnormal expression of proteases, and they have been widely investigated for improving anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy and reducing the related side effects. This paper provides a review of the current application and progress of NDDS developed based on the response and regulation of the microenvironment in the treatment of liver cancer, compares the effects of the microenvironment and the NDDS, and provides a reference for building more advanced NDDS.

Title: Assessing airflow unsteadiness in the human respiratory tract under different expiration conditions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jing Hao, Ge Haiwen, Tang Hui, Farnoud Ali, Saidul Islam Mohammad, Wang Li, Wang Chenglei, Cui Xinguang
Abstract: To enhance the understanding of airflow characteristics in the human respiratory system, the expiratory airflow in a human respiratory tract model was simulated using large eddy simulation and dynamic mesh under different expiration conditions aligned with clinically measured data. The airflow unsteadiness was quantitatively assessed using power spectral density (PSD) and spectral entropy (SE). The following findings were obtained: (1) The airflow is highly turbulent in the mouth-pharynx region during expiration, with its dynamic characteristics being influenced by both the transient expiration flow pattern at mouth piece and the glottis motion. (2) PSD analysis reveals that the expiratory airflow is very unsteady, exhibiting a broad-band attenuation spectrum in the pharynx-trachea region. When only transient expiration or glottis motion is considered, the PSD spectrum changes slightly. When both are ignored, however, the change is significant, with the peak frequency reduced to 10% of the real expiration condition. (3) SE analysis indicates that the airflow transitions into turbulence in the trachea, and there may be multiple transitions in the region of soft palate. The transient expiration or glottis motion alone increases turbulence intensity by 2%-15%, while ignoring both reduces turbulence intensity by 10%-20%. This study implies that turbulence characteristics can be significantly different under different expiratory conditions, and therefore it is necessary to determine the expiratory flow characteristics using clinically measured expiratory data.

Year: 2023
Authors: de Souza Patrícia Farias, da Cunha Danieli Lima, Daflon Sarah Dario Alves, Machado Alcinei Rodrigues, Gaudie-Ley Lucas Wanderley, de Mattos Joel, da Fonseca Estefan Monteiro
Abstract: The present study aimed to evaluate concentrations of 16 priority PAHs in the mussel Perna perna and oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae of the Santos Estuary (Brazil) and the potential risk to human health associated with the consumption of these species. The levels of ΣPAHs in the tissues of bivalves ranged from 96.94 to 988.76 μg/kg for mussels and from 88.38 to 138.62 μg/kg for oysters. A general trend of higher concentrations of PAHs was observed according to the increase in log K<sub>ow</sub> values in both species. The estimated amount of ΣPAHs via mussel and oyster intake ranged from 1.0 to 3.2 ng/kg and from 0.4 to 1.2 ng/kg of body weight per day, respectively. The calculated THQs, HI and CRs for the regular consumption of raw bivalves followed the internationally acceptable limits and represent a low risk to human health.

Year: 2023
Authors: Hua Zizheng, Ke Ying, Yang Ziyi, Di Zhang, Pan Gaofeng, Gao Kun
Abstract: Comprehensive and exceedingly precise centralized patient monitoring has become essential to advance predictive, preventive, and efficient patient care in contemporary healthcare. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology, boasting high-frequency and high-speed wireless communication, holds promise as a viable solution to this challenge. This paper presents a new approach that combines mmWave communication and computer vision (CV) to achieve real-time patient monitoring and data transmission in indoor medical environments. The system comprises a transmitter, a reflective surface, and multiple communication targets, and utilizes the high-frequency, low-latency features of mmWave as well as CV-based target detection and depth estimation for precise localization and reliable data transmission. A machine learning algorithm analyses real-time images captured by an optical camera to identify target distance and direction and establish clear line-of-sight links. The system proactively adapts its transmission power and channel allocation based on the target's movements, guaranteeing complete coverage, even in potentially obstructive areas. This methodology tackles the escalating demand for high-speed, real-time data processing in modern healthcare, significantly enhancing its delivery.

Title: Deep Learning Image Recognition-Assisted Atomic Force Microscopy for Single-Cell Efficient Mechanics in Co-culture Environments.
Year: 2024
Authors: Yang Xuliang, Yang Yanqi, Zhang Zhihui, Li Mi
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy assay has become an important method for characterizing the mechanical properties of single living cells under aqueous conditions, but a disadvantage is its reliance on manual operation and experience as well as the resulting low throughput. Particularly, providing a capacity to accurately identify the type of the cell grown in co-culture environments without the need of fluorescent labeling will further facilitate the applications of AFM in life sciences. Here, we present a study of deep learning image recognition-assisted AFM, which not only enables fluorescence-independent recognition of the identity of single co-cultured cells but also allows efficient downstream AFM force measurements of the identified cells. With the use of the deep learning-based image recognition model, the viability and type of individual cells grown in co-culture environments were identified directly from the optical bright-field images, which were confirmed by the following cell growth and fluorescent labeling results. Based on the image recognition results, the positional relationship between the AFM probe and the targeted cell was automatically determined, allowing the precise movement of the AFM probe to the target cell to perform force measurements. The experimental results show that the presented method was applicable not only to the conventional (microsphere-modified) AFM probe used in AFM indentation assay for measuring the Young's modulus of single co-cultured cells but also to the single-cell probe used in AFM-based single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) assay for measuring the adhesion forces of single co-cultured cells. The study illustrates deep learning imaging recognition-assisted AFM as a promising approach for label-free and high-throughput detection of single-cell mechanics under co-culture conditions, which will facilitate unraveling the mechanical cues involved in cell-cell interactions in their native states at the single-cell level and will benefit the field of mechanobiology.

Year: 2023
Authors: Galindo Pablo, Neyra Javier A
Abstract: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the main extracorporeal kidney support therapy used in critical ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Since its conceptualization ~50 years ago, there have been major improvements in its technology and utilization. The last decade, and particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, has been marked by a growing interest and demand of CRRT in worldwide ICUs. This has underpinned the need for improvements in nomenclature and process standardization, optimization of CRRT deliverables, and the development and validation of key performance indicators. Further, how to leverage digital health technologies to build clinical decision support for CRRT and improve personalized bedside decisions is a subject of intense investigation. Herein, we summarize notable advancements in the provision of CRRT and propose areas in need of further development. (Rev Invest Clin. 2023;75(6):348-58).

Title: Passivating Dipole Layer Bridged 3D/2D Perovskite Heterojunction for Highly Efficient and Stable p-i-n Solar Cells.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zang Xiaoxiao, Xiong Shaobing, Jiang Sheng, Li Di, Wu Hongbo, Ren Hao, Cao Aiping, Li Bo, Ma Zaifei, Chen Jinde, Ding Liming, Tang Jianxin, Sun Zhenrong, Chu Junhao, Bao Qinye
Abstract: Constructing 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction is a promising approach to integrate the benefits of high efficiency and superior stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, in contrast to n-i-p architectural PSCs, the p-i-n PSCs with 3D/2D heterojunction have serious limitations in achieving high-performance as they suffer from a large energetic mismatch and electron extraction energy barrier from a 3D perovskite layer to a 2D perovskite layer, and serious nonradiative recombination at the heterojunction. Here a strategy of incorporating a thin passivating dipole layer (PDL) onto 3D perovskite and then depositing 2D perovskite without dissolving the underlying layer to form an efficient 3D/PDL/2D heterojunction is developed. It is revealed that PDL regulates the energy level alignment with the appearance of interfacial dipole and strongly interacts with 3D perovskite through covalent bonds, which eliminate the energetic mismatch, reduce the surface defects, suppress the nonradiative recombination, and thus accelerate the charge extraction at such electron-selective contact. As a result, it is reported that the 3D/PDL/2D junction p-i-n PSCs present a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% with robust stability, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art efficiency of the 3D/2D junction n-i-p devices.

Title: Charge Exchange and Transfer between Water and van der Waals Monolayers Under Tensile Strains.
Year: 2024
Authors: Wang Yue, Guo Wanlin, Guo Yufeng
Abstract: Charge exchange and transfer between water and low-dimensional materials are critical for water-related nanogenerators to harvest electricity from water. By first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, the interface interaction and charge transfer between ion-containing or pure water and two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals monolayers including transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, and graphene have been systematically investigated. Applying uniaxial tensile strain or the introduction of defects on 2D monolayers could significantly enhance the interface interaction and charge transfer from 2D monolayers to water molecules, as the tensile strain or defect weakens the bonds of 2D monolayers and changes the hydrogen bond networks in the interfacial water layer. In contrast, the presence of ions in water suppresses the charge transfer from 2D monolayers to water molecules and reduces interfacial adhesion because of the formation of hydrated ions and stronger charge exchange between ions and water molecules. These results reveal the role of strain, defect, and ion in dominating the charge exchange and transfer between water and 2D monolayers.

Title: An efficient constructive heuristic for the rectangular packing problem with rotations.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhao Xusheng, Rao Yunqing, Qi Peng, Lyu Qianhang, Yang Piaoruo, Yu Shoubo
Abstract: The rectangular packing problem has been extensively studied over the years due to its wide application in industry. However, most of the research efforts are devoted to positioning techniques of the rectangles for various problem variants, the efficient implementation of the packing procedure is relatively less studied. In this paper, we propose an efficient constructive algorithm for the rectangular packing problem with rotations. We design a preprocess procedure with four data structures to store the information used for item selection. The gaps on the skyline are categorized into three types according to their associated edges for the placement procedure, during which the item is searched and packed in a descending order of the fitness value. The entire constructive phase takes a time complexity of O(nlogn). For the packing improvement phase, we optimize the packing through random perturbation on the sequence and orientation of the item. Three classes of stochastic problems are generated ranging from small-scale to extra-large-scale, the recorded running time confirms the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We also test the proposed algorithm on the benchmark problem C21, N13, NT, Babu and CX, the computational results show that it delivers a good performance.

Title: The mediation and interaction of the obesity index between moderate-vigorous recreational physical activity and hypertension.
Year: 2023
Authors: Du Bingqian, Li Yuting, Xia Yun, Wu Shan, Wei Yuan, Wang Zhihao, Wang Shupei, Guo Jiao, Zhu Qing, Shen Tianran, Chen Qingsong
Abstract: Previous studies showed that physical activity (PA) is concerned with hypertension (HTN). However, the mediation and interaction role of the obesity index: body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), body fat rate (BFR) and visceral fat index (VFI) between PA and HTN has never been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the mediation and interaction of the obesity index between moderate-vigorous recreational physical activity (MVRPA) and HTN. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 4710 individuals aged 41 or older in Torch Development Zone, Zhongshan City. The mediation and interaction of the obesity index were evaluated by a four-way decomposition. 48.07% of participants had HTN among these groups. In the adjusted linear regression model, MVRPA was significantly correlated with WHR (β±SE = -0.005±0.002; P<0.05). Compared to sufficient MVRPA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35), 95% (confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-1.56), insufficient MVRPA increased the risk of developing HTN. Furthermore, there were associations between BMI, WHR, BFR, VFI and HTN where the adjusted ORs and 95% CIs were 1.11 (1.09-1.13), 6.23 (2.61-14.90), 1.04 (1.03-1.06), 1.07 (1.06-1.09), respectively. The mediation analyses suggested that the impact of MVRPA on HTN risk may partly be explained by changes in obesity index, with a pure indirect mediation of WHR between MVRPA and HTN (P<0.05). Therefore, weight control, especially reducing abdominal obesity and maintaining adequate MVRPA, may lead to more proper control of HTN.

Title: Dynamic Model Interpretation-Guided Online Active Learning Scheme for Real-Time Safety Assessment.
Year: 2023
Authors: He Xiao, Liu Zeyi
Abstract: Chunk-level real-time safety assessment of dynamic systems is a critical component of industrial processes, which is essential to prevent hazards and reduce the risk of injury or damage to equipment and facilities, especially in nonstationary environments. In this context, multiple real and complex concept drifts are inevitable in industrial settings, making it crucial to understand their detection and adaptation processes. The incremental learning scheme should also be well considered. However, existing methods have certain limitations in dealing with such issues. In this article, a dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme, termed a dynamic model interpretation-guided learning scheme (DMI-LS), is proposed. Specifically, the model update strategy with chunk data is designed based on the implementation of the broad learning system. A novel query strategy is then investigated to consider the ranking preference difference, which relies on the interpretation generated by the explainable artificial intelligence method. Several experiments based on the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to verify the effects of the proposed DMI-LS. The results show that it outperforms the other advanced existing approaches with different settings in most scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving effective hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) across a wide pH span is of critical importance in unlocking the full potential of hydrogen energy but remains intrinsically challenging. Here, we engineer the N-coordinated Ir-Mo dual atoms on a carbon matrix by ultrafast high-temperature sintering, creating an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and HOR in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The optimized catalyst, Ir-Mo DAC/NC, demonstrates exceptional performance, with a significantly reduced HER overpotential of 11.3 mV at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a HOR exchange current (<i>i</i><sup>0,m</sup>) of 3972 mA/mg<sub>Ir</sub> in acidic conditions, surpassing the performance of Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. In alkaline conditions, Ir-Mo DAC/NC also outperforms Pt/C, as evidenced by its low HER overpotential of 23 mV at 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a high <i>i</i><sup>0,m</sup> of 1308 mA/mg<sub>Ir</sub>. Furthermore, our catalyst exhibits remarkable stability in both acidic and alkaline environments. DFT calculations results reveal that the superior electrochemical performance of Ir-Mo DAC/NC arises from the electronic synergy between Ir and Mo pairs, which regulates the interaction between the intermediates and active sites. These findings present a promising strategy for the development of dual-atom catalysts (DACs), with potential applications in the polymer fuel cells and water electrolyzers.

Year: 2023
Authors: Suresh Kummari, Pillai Devika, Soman Manju, Sreenivas Akula, Paul Robin
Abstract: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence, underlying resistance mechanism, and virulence involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 35) isolated from freshwater fishes in Andhra Pradesh, India. Antibiogram studies revealed that 68.5, 62.8, 37.1, 11.4, 8.5, 57.1, 54.2, and 48.5% of isolates had resistance to oxytetracycline, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ampicillin, respectively. The resistant isolates harboured the tetA (85.7%), tetD (71.4%), tetM (91.4%), sul1 (80%), bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> (57.1%), bla<sub>TEM</sub> (42.8%), and bla<sub>SHV</sub> (48.5%) genes. In total, 50% of the isolates were altered as multi-drug resistant, and the multiple antibiotic resistance index was calculated as 0.4. Furthermore, 37.3, 48.5, and 14.2% of isolates were categorized as strong, moderate, and weak biofilm formers, possessing pslA (91.5%) and pslD (88.6%) biofilm encoding genes. In total, 82.8% of the isolates exhibited efflux pump activity and harboured the mexA (74.2%), mexB (77.1%), and oprM (37.1%) genes. Virulent genes oprL, toxA, exoS, and phzM were detected in 68.5, 68.5, 100, and 17.1% of isolates, respectively. The data suggested that P. aeruginosa harbours multiple resistance mechanisms and virulence factors that may contribute to antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity, and their distribution in fish culture facilities highlights the public health hazards of the food chain.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by altered brain connectivity and function. In this study, we employed advanced bioinformatics and explainable AI to analyze gene expression associated with ASD, using data from five GEO datasets. Among 351 neurotypical controls and 358 individuals with autism, we identified 3,339 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) with an adjusted p-value (≤ 0.05). A subsequent meta-analysis pinpointed 342 DEGs (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.001), including 19 upregulated and 10 down-regulated genes across all datasets. Shared genes, pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), chromosomal positions, and their impact on biological pathways were examined. We identified potential biomarkers (HOXB3, NR2F2, MAPK8IP3, PIGT, SEMA4D, and SSH1) through text mining, meriting further investigation. Additionally, ‎we shed light on the roles of RPS4Y1 and KDM5D genes in neurogenesis and neurodevelopment. Our analysis detected 1,286 SNPs linked to ASD-related conditions, of which 14 high-risk SNPs were located on chromosomes 10 and X. We highlighted potential missense SNPs associated with FGFR inhibitors, suggesting that it may serve as a promising biomarker for responsiveness to targeted therapies. Our explainable AI model identified the MID2 gene as a potential ASD biomarker. This research unveils vital genes and potential biomarkers, providing a foundation for novel gene discovery in complex diseases.

Title: Why the Funnel in Neurosurgery?
Year: 2023
Authors: Visocchi Massimiliano
Abstract: According to Cambridge Dictionary, Funnel is an object that has a wide round opening at the top, sloping sides, and a narrow tube at the bottom, used for pouring liquids or powders into containers with narrow necks.From an semplified anatomic point of view, the skull base along with its offshoot, the spine, replicate a bone funnel as a vessel sustaining the brain, the cerebellum and the spinal cord along with cranial and radicular nerves. Non doubt at all that the knowledge of the embryology, anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and the more effective surgical pathways to engage and remove surgical diseases is of paramount importance in the surgical cultural heritage to be strongly encouraged and supported in young neurosurgeons.So to the steps that seem to emerge from this Issue of Acta Neurochirurgica suppl are exploratory, strategic, tactical and finally operational. From the skull base to the sacrum we meet a macrosystem of anatomic and functional complex network with a common embryological hystory as well as contiguity. Different skills are necessary to face with a 360° universe of functions and diseases to deal with. Intelligence and culture as knowledge of both anatomy and pathology help to elaborate the STRATEGY while technical and manual supports are part of the TACTIC armamentarium which is proactive and determinant to the final OPERATIONAL step.

Title: Magnitude and Correlates of Symptomatic, Global Illness, and Social Functioning Response; Out-of-Home Placement; and Length of Stay in 1,189 Consecutively Hospitalized Children and Adolescents With Mental Disorders.
Year: 2023
Authors: Nöhles Viktor B, Jaite Charlotte, Rubarth Kerstin, Heuer Fabiola H, Bödeker Katja, Golz Laura, Winter Sibylle M, Correll Christoph U
Abstract: <b><i>Objective:</i></b> To identify outcome predictors in hospitalized youth with mental disorders. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This retrospective analysis of systematically recorded clinical parameters in youth hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in 2004-2015 assessed magnitude and correlates of symptom response (SR), global illness response (GIR), social functioning (SF), out-of-home placement (OOHP), and length of stay (LOS). Backward elimination regression analyses were performed to identify independent baseline correlates of each of the 5 outcomes, with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> representing the variance explained by the independent correlates retained in the final model. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Across 1,189 youth (median age = 14.4 years; interquartile range = 11.6,16.1 years; range, 5-19 years; females = 61.5%), frequencies of coprimary outcomes were as follows: SR = 57.5% (statistically significant correlates = 13, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.154), GIR = 30.0% (correlates = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.078), SF = 19.0% (correlates = 8, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.207), OOHP recommendation = 35.2% (correlates = 13, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.275), and mean ± SD LOS = 65.0 ± 37.5 days (correlates = 11, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.219). In multivariable analyses, 11 factors were statistically significantly (<i>P</i> < .05) associated with > 1 poor outcome: 4 with 4 outcomes (disturbed social interaction, substance abuse/dependence symptoms; sole exception for both = LOS; disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, sole exception = OOHP; higher admission BMI percentile [but shorter LOS], sole exception = GIR), 3 with 3 outcomes (higher admission age [but good SF and shorter LOS], more abnormal psychosocial circumstances, more mental health diagnoses), and 4 with 2 outcomes (intelligence level [IQ] < 85, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, disturbed social behavior, somatic findings). Additionally, 17 correlates were statistically significantly (<i>P</i> < .05) associated with 1 outcome, ie, SR = 6, OOHP = 5, LOS = 5, SF = 1. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Higher admission BMI percentile, disturbed social interaction, disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, and substance abuse/dependence symptoms were independently associated with multiple poor outcomes in mentally ill youth requiring inpatient care. Knowledge of global and specific correlates of poor inpatient treatment outcomes may help inform treatment decisions.

Title: Computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Trayanova Natalia A, Lyon Aurore, Shade Julie, Heijman Jordi
Abstract: The complexity of cardiac electrophysiology, involving dynamic changes in numerous components across multiple spatial (from ion channel to organ) and temporal (from milliseconds to days) scales makes an intuitive or empirical analysis of cardiac arrhythmogenesis challenging. Multiscale mechanistic computational models of cardiac electrophysiology provide precise control over individual parameters, and their reproducibility enables a thorough assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of models of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. from the single cell to the organ level, and how they can be leveraged to better understand rhythm disorders in cardiac disease and to improve heart patient care. Key issues related to model development based on experimental data are discussed and major families of human cardiomyocyte models and their applications are highlighted. An overview of organ-level computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology and its clinical applications in personalized arrhythmia risk assessment and patient-specific therapy of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is provided. The advancements presented here highlight how patient-specific computational models of the heart reconstructed from patient clinical data have achieved success in predicting risk of sudden cardiac death and guiding optimal treatments of heart rhythm disorders. Finally, an outlook towards potential future advances, including the combination of mechanistic modeling and machine learning / artificial intelligence, is provided. As the field of cardiology is embarking on a journey towards precision medicine, personalized modeling of the heart is expected to become a key technology to guide pharmaceutical therapy, deployment of devices, and surgical interventions.

Year: 2024
Authors: Zhong Haiyang, Wang Xinyue, Chen Shicheng, Wang Zhe, Wang Huating, Xu Lei, Hou Tingjun, Yao Xiaojun, Li Dan, Pan Peichen
Abstract: Androgen receptor (AR) is the primary target for treating prostate cancer (PCa), which inevitably progresses due to drug-resistant mutations. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has been a new potential drug target for PCa treatment. Herein, we report the rational design and discovery of novel BRD4 inhibitors through computer-aided drug design (CADD), and a hit compound SQ-1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 676 nM) was identified by structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) with the conserved water network. To optimize the structure of SQ-1, the free energy landscape was constructed, and the binding mechanism was explored by characterizing the water profile and the dissociation mechanism. Finally, the compound SQ-17 with improved inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 100 nM) was discovered, which showed potent antiproliferative activity against LNCaP. These data highlighted a successful attempt to identify and optimize a small molecule by comprehensive CADD application and provided essential clues for developing novel therapeutics for PCa treatment.

Title: Test-Time Training for Deep MS/MS Spectrum Prediction Improves Peptide Identification.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ye Jianbai, He Xiangnan, Wang Shujuan, Dong Meng-Qiu, Wu Feng, Lu Shan, Feng Fuli
Abstract: In bottom-up proteomics, peptide-spectrum matching is critical for peptide and protein identification. Recently, deep learning models have been used to predict tandem mass spectra of peptides, enabling the calculation of similarity scores between the predicted and experimental spectra for peptide-spectrum matching. These models follow the supervised learning paradigm, which trains a general model using paired peptides and spectra from standard data sets and directly employs the model on experimental data. However, this approach can lead to inaccurate predictions due to differences between the training data and the experimental data, such as sample types, enzyme specificity, and instrument calibration. To tackle this problem, we developed a test-time training paradigm that adapts the pretrained model to generate experimental data-specific models, namely, PepT3. PepT3 yields a 10-40% increase in peptide identification depending on the variability in training and experimental data. Intriguingly, when applied to a patient-derived immunopeptidomic sample, PepT3 increases the identification of tumor-specific immunopeptide candidates by 60%. Two-thirds of the newly identified candidates are predicted to bind to the patient's human leukocyte antigen isoforms. To facilitate access of the model and all the results, we have archived all the intermediate files in Zenodo.org with identifier 8231084.

Title: Filamentous-Actin-Mimicking Nanoplatform for Enhanced Cytosolic Protein Delivery.
Year: 2023
Authors: Xia Yuqiong, Wu Keyun, Liu Chang, Zhao Xuejuan, Wang Jun, Cao Jianxia, Chen Zhaoxu, Fang Minchao, Yu Jie, Zhu Cheng, Zhang Xianghan, Wang Zhongliang
Abstract: Despite the potential of protein therapeutics, the cytosolic delivery of proteins with high efficiency and bioactivity remains a significant challenge owing to exocytosis and lysosomal degradation after endocytosis. Therefore, it is important to develop a safe and efficient strategy to bypass endocytosis. Inspired by the extraordinary capability of filamentous-actin (F-actin) to promote cell membrane fusion, a cyanine dye assembly-containing nanoplatform mimicking the structure of natural F-actin is developed. The nanoplatform exhibits fast membrane fusion to cell membrane mimics and thus enters live cells through membrane fusion and bypasses endocytosis. Moreover, it is found to efficiently deliver protein cargos into live cells and quickly release them into the cytosol, leading to high protein cargo transfection efficiency and bioactivity. The nanoplatform also results in the superior inhibition of tumor cells when loaded with anti-tumor proteins. These results demonstrate that this fusogenic nanoplatform can be valuable for cytosolic protein delivery and tumor treatment.

Title: A Multifunctional Flexible Tactile Sensor Based on Resistive Effect for Simultaneous Sensing of Pressure and Temperature.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhu Haodong, Luo Hongyu, Cai Min, Song Jizhou
Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors with multifunctional sensing functions have attracted much attention due to their wide applications in artificial limbs, intelligent robots, human-machine interfaces, and health monitoring devices. Here, a multifunctional flexible tactile sensor based on resistive effect for simultaneous sensing of pressure and temperature is reported. The sensor features a simple design with patterned metal film on a soft substrate with cavities and protrusions. The decoupling of pressure and temperature sensing is achieved by the reasonable arrangement of metal layers in the patterned metal film. Systematically experimental and numerical studies are carried out to reveal the multifunctional sensing mechanism and show that the proposed sensor exhibits good linearity, fast response, high stability, good mechanical flexibility, and good microfabrication compatibility. Demonstrations of the multifunctional flexible tactile sensor to monitor touch, breathing, pulse and objects grabbing/releasing in various application scenarios involving coupled temperature/pressure stimuli illustrate its excellent capability of measuring pressure and temperature simultaneously. These results offer an effective tool for multifunctional sensing of pressure and temperature and create engineering opportunities for applications of wearable health monitoring and human-machine interfaces.

Title: Navigating the Ethical Landmines of ChatGPT: Implications of Intelligent Chatbots in Plastic Surgery Clinical Practice.
Year: 2023
Authors: Oleck Nicholas C, Naga Hani I, Nichols D Spencer, Morris Miranda X, Dhingra Bhuwan, Patel Ash
Abstract: ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI with the potential to impact all facets of plastic surgery from research to clinical practice. New applications for ChatGPT are emerging at a rapid pace in both the scientific literature and popular media. It is important for clinicians to understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools before patient-facing implementation. In this article, the authors explore some of the technical details behind ChatGPT: what it is, and what it is not. As with any emerging technology, attention should be given to the ethical and health equity implications of this technology on our plastic surgery patients. The authors explore these concerns within the framework of the foundational principles of biomedical ethics: patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. ChatGPT and similar intelligent conversation agents have incredible promise in the field of plastic surgery but should be used cautiously and sparingly in their current form. To protect patients, it is imperative that societal guidelines for the safe use of this rapidly developing technology are developed.

Title: Mitigating Membership Inference in Deep Survival Analyses with Differential Privacy.
Year: 2023
Authors: Fan Liyue, Bonomi Luca
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been increasingly integrated in healthcare applications to enable accurate predicative analyses. Sharing trained deep models not only facilitates knowledge integration in collaborative research efforts but also enables equitable access to computational intelligence. However, recent studies have shown that an adversary may leverage a shared model to learn the participation of a target individual in the training set. In this work, we investigate privacy-protecting model sharing for survival studies. Specifically, we pose three research questions. (1) Do deep survival models leak membership information? (2) How effective is differential privacy in defending against membership inference in deep survival analyses? (3) Are there other effects of differential privacy on deep survival analyses? Our study assesses the membership leakage in emerging deep survival models and develops differentially private training procedures to provide rigorous privacy protection. The experimental results show that deep survival models leak membership information and our approach effectively reduces membership inference risks. The results also show that differential privacy introduces a limited performance loss, and may improve the model robustness in the presence of noisy data, compared to non-private models.

Title: Emergence Patterns from General Anesthesia after Epilepsy Surgery: An Observational Pilot Study.
Year: 2023
Authors: Venkatraghavan Lashmi, Bhardwaj Suparna, Banik Sujoy, Chowdhury Tumul, McAndrews Mary Pat, Valiante Taufik
Abstract: <b>Objective</b> Emergence from anesthesia starts from the limbic structures and then spreads outwards to brainstem, reticular activating systems, and then to the cortex. Epilepsy surgery often involves resection of limbic structures and hence may disrupt the pattern of emergence. The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of emergence from anesthesia following epilepsy surgery and to determine associated variables affecting the emergence pattern. <b>Setting and Design</b>  Tertiary care center, prospective observational study. <b>Materials</b>   <b>and Methods</b> We conducted a prospective observation pilot study on adult patients undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy for epilepsy. Anesthesia management was standardized in all patients, and they were allowed to wake up with "no touch" technique. Primary outcome of the study was the pattern of emergence (normal emergence, agitated emergence, or slow emergence) from anesthesia. Secondary outcomes were to explore the differences in preoperative neuropsychological profile and limbic structure volumes between the different patterns of emergence. Quantitative variables were analyzed using Student's <i>t</i> -test. Qualitative variables were analyzed using chi-square test. <b>Results</b>  Twenty-nine patients completed the study: 9 patients (31%) had agitated emergence, and 20 patients had normal emergence. Among the agitated emergence, 2 patients had Riker scale of 7 indicating violent emergence. Patient demographics, anesthetic used, neuropsychological profile, and limbic structure volumes were similar between normal emergence and agitated emergence groups. However, two patients who had severe agitation (Riker scale of 7) had the lowest intelligence quotient. <b>Conclusion</b>  Our pilot study showed that emergence agitation is not uncommon in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. However, due to smaller sample size, the role of preoperative neuropsychologic profile and hippocampal volumes in predicting the pattern of emergence is inconclusive.

Title: Behind the Bait: Delving into <i>PhishTank's</i> hidden data.
Year: 2024
Authors: Yasin Affan, Fatima Rubia, Khan Javed Ali, Afzal Wasif
Abstract: Phishing constitutes a form of social engineering that aims to deceive individuals through email communication. Extensive prior research has underscored phishing as one of the most commonly employed attack vectors for infiltrating organizational networks. A prevalent method involves misleading the target by employing phishing URLs concealed through hyperlink strategies. <i>PhishTank</i>, a website employing the concept of crowd-sourcing, aggregates phishing URLs and subsequently verifies their authenticity. In the course of this study, we leveraged a Python script to extract data from the <i>PhishTank</i> website, amassing a comprehensive dataset comprising over 190,0000 phishing URLs. This dataset is a valuable resource that can be harnessed by both researchers and practitioners for enhancing phish- ing filters, fortifying firewalls, security education, and refining training and testing models, among other applications.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects ∼2%-3% of the population globally. Studying spontaneous OCD-like behaviors in non-human primates may improve our understanding of the disorder. In large rhesus monkey colonies, we found 10 monkeys spontaneously exhibiting persistent sequential motor behaviors (SMBs) in individual-specific sequences that were repetitive, time-consuming and stable over prolonged periods. Genetic analysis revealed severely damaging mutations in genes associated with OCD risk in humans. Brain imaging showed that monkeys with SMBs had larger gray matter (GM) volumes in the left caudate nucleus and lower fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum. The GM volume of the left caudate nucleus correlated positively with the daily duration of SMBs. Notably, exposure to a stressor (human presence) significantly increased SMBs. In addition, fluoxetine, a serotonergic medication commonly used for OCD, decreased SMBs in these monkeys. These findings provide a novel foundation for developing better understanding and treatment of OCD.

Title: Word-based GWAS harnesses the rich potential of genomic data for <i>E. coli</i> quinolone resistance.
Year: 2023
Authors: Malekian Negin, Sainath Srividhya, Al-Fatlawi Ali, Schroeder Michael
Abstract: Quinolone resistance presents a growing global health threat. We employed word-based GWAS to explore genomic data, aiming to enhance our understanding of this phenomenon. Unlike traditional variant-based GWAS analyses, this approach simultaneously captures multiple genomic factors, including single and interacting resistance mutations and genes. Analyzing a dataset of 92 genomic <i>E. coli</i> samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Dresden, we identified 54 DNA unitigs significantly associated with quinolone resistance. Remarkably, our analysis not only validated known mutations in <i>gyrA</i> and <i>parC</i> genes and the results of our variant-based GWAS but also revealed new (mutated) genes such as <i>mdfA</i>, the AcrEF-TolC multidrug efflux system, <i>ptrB</i>, and <i>hisI</i>, implicated in antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, our study identified joint mutations in 14 genes including the known <i>gyrA</i> gene, providing insights into potential synergistic effects contributing to quinolone resistance. These findings showcase the exceptional capabilities of word-based GWAS in unraveling the intricate genomic foundations of quinolone resistance.

Title: Use of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in Gerontology: Benefits, Considerations and a Promising Future.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bednorz Adam, Mak Jonathan K L, Jylhävä Juulia, Religa Dorota
Abstract: Electronic medical records (EMRs) have many benefits in clinical research in gerontology, enabling data analysis, development of prognostic tools and disease risk prediction. EMRs also offer a range of advantages in clinical practice, such as comprehensive medical records, streamlined communication with healthcare providers, remote data access, and rapid retrieval of test results, ultimately leading to increased efficiency, enhanced patient safety, and improved quality of care in gerontology, which includes benefits like reduced medication use and better patient history taking and physical examination assessments. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches on EMRs can further improve disease diagnosis, symptom classification, and support clinical decision-making. However, there are also challenges related to data quality, data entry errors, as well as the ethics and safety of using AI in healthcare. This article discusses the future of EMRs in gerontology and the application of AI and ML in clinical research. Ethical and legal issues surrounding data sharing and the need for healthcare professionals to critically evaluate and integrate these technologies are also emphasized. The article concludes by discussing the challenges related to the use of EMRs in research as well as in their primary intended use, the daily clinical practice.

Title: [Research progress of brain-computer interface application paradigms based on rapid serial visual presentation].
Year: 2023
Authors: Sun Jingmin, Meng Jiayuan, You Jia, Yang Mingming, Jiang Jing, Xu Minpeng, Ming Dong
Abstract: Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is a type of psychological visual stimulation experimental paradigm that requires participants to identify target stimuli presented continuously in a stream of stimuli composed of numbers, letters, words, images, and so on at the same spatial location, allowing them to discern a large amount of information in a short period of time. The RSVP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can not only be widely used in scenarios such as assistive interaction and information reading, but also has the advantages of stability and high efficiency, which has become one of the common techniques for human-machine intelligence fusion. In recent years, brain-controlled spellers, image recognition and mind games are the most popular fields of RSVP-BCI research. Therefore, aiming to provide reference and new ideas for RSVP-BCI related research, this paper reviewed the paradigm design and system performance optimization of RSVP-BCI in these three fields. It also looks ahead to its potential applications in cutting-edge fields such as entertainment, clinical medicine, and special military operations.

Authors: Wang Longlong, Li Shuangyan, Li Runze, Xu Guizhi
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment, with the predominant clinical diagnosis of spatial working memory (SWM) deficiency, which seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients. However, the current pharmacological therapies have unsatisfactory cure rates and other problems, so non-pharmacological physical therapies have gradually received widespread attention. Recently, a novel treatment using 40 Hz light flicker stimulation (40 Hz-LFS) to rescue the cognitive function of model animals with AD has made initial progress, but the neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this paper will explore the potential neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of SWM by 40 Hz-LFS based on cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Ten adult Wistar rats were first subjected to acute LFS at frequencies of 20, 40, and 60 Hz. The entrainment effect of LFS with different frequency on neural oscillations in the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was analyzed. The results showed that acute 40 Hz-LFS was able to develop strong entrainment and significantly modulate the oscillation power of the low-frequency gamma (lγ) rhythms. The rats were then randomly divided into experimental and control groups of 5 rats each for a long-term 40 Hz-LFS (7 d). Their SWM function was assessed by a T-maze task, and the CFC changes in the HPC-mPFC circuit were analyzed by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). The results showed that the behavioral performance of the experimental group was improved and the PAC of θ-lγ rhythm was enhanced, and the difference was statistically significant. The results of this paper suggested that the long-term 40 Hz-LFS effectively improved SWM function in rats, which may be attributed to its enhanced communication of different rhythmic oscillations in the relevant neural circuits. It is expected that the study in this paper will build a foundation for further research on the mechanism of 40 Hz-LFS to improve cognitive function and promote its clinical application in the future.

Title: [Effects of 50 Hz electromagnetic field on rat working memory and investigation of neural mechanisms].
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Longlong, Li Shuangyan, Li Tianxiang, Zheng Weiran, Li Yang, Xu Guizhi
Abstract: With the widespread use of electrical equipment, cognitive functions such as working memory (WM) could be severely affected when people are exposed to 50 Hz electromagnetic fields (EMF) for long term. However, the effects of EMF exposure on WM and its neural mechanism remain unclear. In the present paper, 15 rats were randomly assigned to three groups, and exposed to an EMF environment at 50 Hz and 2 mT for a different duration: 0 days (control group), 24 days (experimental group I), and 48 days (experimental group II). Then, their WM function was assessed by the T-maze task. Besides, their local field potential (LFP) in the media prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was recorded by the <i>in vivo</i> multichannel electrophysiological recording system to study the power spectral density (PSD) of θ and γ oscillations and the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) intensity of θ-γ oscillations during the T-maze task. The results showed that the PSD of θ and γ oscillations decreased in experimental groups I and II, and the PAC intensity between θ and high-frequency γ (hγ) decreased significantly compared to the control group. The number of days needed to meet the task criterion was more in experimental groups I and II than that of control group. The results indicate that long-term exposure to EMF could impair WM function. The possible reason may be the impaired communication between different rhythmic oscillations caused by a decrease in θ-hγ PAC intensity. This paper demonstrates the negative effects of EMF on WM and reveals the potential neural mechanisms from the changes of PAC intensity, which provides important support for further investigation of the biological effects of EMF and its mechanisms.

Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Yuqiang, Wang Jiachen, Zhang Jian, Luo Zeruxin, Guo Yingqiang, Zhang Zhengbo, Yu Pengming
Abstract: In recent years, wearable devices have seen a booming development, and the integration of wearable devices with clinical settings is an important direction in the development of wearable devices. The purpose of this study is to establish a prediction model for postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) by continuously monitoring respiratory physiological parameters of cardiac valve surgery patients during the preoperative 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) with a wearable device. By enrolling 53 patients with cardiac valve diseases in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, the grouping was based on the presence or absence of PPCs in the postoperative period. The 6MWT continuous respiratory physiological parameters collected by the SensEcho wearable device were analyzed, and the group differences in respiratory parameters and oxygen saturation parameters were calculated, and a prediction model was constructed. The results showed that continuous monitoring of respiratory physiological parameters in 6MWT using a wearable device had a better predictive trend for PPCs in cardiac valve surgery patients, providing a novel reference model for integrating wearable devices with the clinic.

Title: [Exploratory study on quantitative analysis of nocturnal breathing patterns in patients with acute heart failure based on wearable devices].
Year: 2023
Authors: Li Mengwei, Kang Yu, Kou Yuqing, Zhao Shuanglin, Zhang Xiu, Qiu Lirui, Yan Wei, Yu Pengming, Zhang Qing, Zhang Zhengbo
Abstract: Patients with acute heart failure (AHF) often experience dyspnea, and monitoring and quantifying their breathing patterns can provide reference information for disease and prognosis assessment. In this study, 39 AHF patients and 24 healthy subjects were included. Nighttime chest-abdominal respiratory signals were collected using wearable devices, and the differences in nocturnal breathing patterns between the two groups were quantitatively analyzed. Compared with the healthy group, the AHF group showed a higher mean breathing rate (BR_mean) [(21.03 ± 3.84) beat/min <i>vs.</i> (15.95 ± 3.08) beat/min, <i>P</i> < 0.001], and larger R_RSBI_cv [70.96% (54.34%-104.28)% <i>vs.</i> 58.48% (45.34%-65.95)%, <i>P</i> = 0.005], greater AB_ratio_cv [(22.52 ± 7.14)% <i>vs.</i> (17.10 ± 6.83)%, <i>P</i> = 0.004], and smaller SampEn (0.67 ± 0.37 <i>vs.</i> 1.01 ± 0.29, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Additionally, the mean inspiratory time (TI_mean) and expiration time (TE_mean) were shorter, TI_cv and TE_cv were greater. Furthermore, the LBI_cv was greater, while SD1 and SD2 on the Poincare plot were larger in the AHF group, all of which showed statistically significant differences. Logistic regression calibration revealed that the TI_mean reduction was a risk factor for AHF. The BR_ mean demonstrated the strongest ability to distinguish between the two groups, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846. Parameters such as breathing period, amplitude, coordination, and nonlinear parameters effectively quantify abnormal breathing patterns in AHF patients. Specifically, the reduction in TI_mean serves as a risk factor for AHF, while the BR_mean distinguishes between the two groups. These findings have the potential to provide new information for the assessment of AHF patients.

Abstract: Wearable monitoring, which has the advantages of continuous monitoring for a long time with low physiological and psychological load, represents a future development direction of monitoring technology. Based on wearable physiological monitoring technology, combined with Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technology, this paper has developed an intelligent monitoring system, including wearable hardware, ward Internet of Things platform, continuous physiological data analysis algorithm and software. We explored the clinical value of continuous physiological data using this system through a lot of clinical practices. And four value points were given, namely, real-time monitoring, disease assessment, prediction and early warning, and rehabilitation training. Depending on the real clinical environment, we explored the mode of applying wearable technology in general ward monitoring, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, and integrated monitoring inside and outside the hospital. The research results show that this monitoring system can be effectively used for monitoring of patients in hospital, evaluation and training of patients' cardiopulmonary function, and management of patients outside hospital.

Title: [Wearable devices: Perspectives on assessing and monitoring human physiological status].
Year: 2023
Authors: Peng Chung-Kang, Cui Xingran, Zhang Zhengbo, Yu Mengsun
Abstract: This review article aims to explore the major challenges that the healthcare system is currently facing and propose a new paradigm shift that harnesses the potential of wearable devices and novel theoretical frameworks on health and disease. Lifestyle-induced diseases currently account for a significant portion of all healthcare spending, with this proportion projected to increase with population aging. Wearable devices have emerged as a key technology for implementing large-scale healthcare systems focused on disease prevention and management. Advancements in miniaturized sensors, system integration, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies have enabled wearable devices to perform high-quality measurements comparable to medical devices. Through various physical, chemical, and biological sensors, wearable devices can continuously monitor physiological status information in a non-invasive or minimally invasive way, including electrocardiography, electroencephalography, respiration, blood oxygen, blood pressure, blood glucose, activity, and more. Furthermore, by combining concepts and methods from complex systems and nonlinear dynamics, we developed a novel theory of continuous dynamic physiological signal analysis-dynamical complexity. The results of dynamic signal analyses can provide crucial information for disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. Wearable devices can also serve as an important bridge connecting doctors and patients by tracking, storing, and sharing patient data with medical institutions, enabling remote or real-time health assessments of patients, and providing a basis for precision medicine and personalized treatment. Wearable devices have a promising future in the healthcare field and will be an important driving force for the transformation of the healthcare system, while also improving the health experience for individuals.

Title: Objective assessment of autism spectrum disorder based on performance in structured interpersonal acting-out tasks with prosodic stability and variability.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ochi Keiko, Kojima Masaki, Ono Nobutaka, Kuroda Miho, Owada Keiho, Sagayama Shigeki, Yamasue Hidenori
Abstract: In this study, we sought to objectively and quantitatively characterize the prosodic features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) via the characteristics of prosody in a newly developed structured speech experiment. Male adults with high-functioning ASD and age/intelligence-matched men with typical development (TD) were asked to read 29 brief scripts aloud in response to preceding auditory stimuli. To investigate whether (1) highly structured acting-out tasks can uncover the prosodic of difference between those with ASD and TD, and (2) the prosodic stableness and flexibleness can be used for objective automatic assessment of ASD, we compared prosodic features such as fundamental frequency, intensity, and mora duration. The results indicate that individuals with ASD exhibit stable pitch registers or volume levels in some affective vocal-expression scenarios, such as those involving anger or sadness, compared with TD and those with TD. However, unstable prosody was observed in some timing control or emphasis tasks in the participants with ASD. Automatic classification of the ASD and TD groups using a support vector machine (SVM) with speech features exhibited an accuracy of 90.4%. A machine learning-based assessment of the degree of ASD core symptoms using support vector regression (SVR) also had good performance. These results may inform the development of a new easy-to-use assessment tool for ASD core symptoms using recorded audio signals.

Authors: Guzman-Pando Abimael, Ramirez-Alonso Graciela, Arzate-Quintana Carlos, Camarillo-Cisneros Javier
Abstract: Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of deep learning techniques in the molecular sciences, which have shown high performance on datasets and the ability to generalize across data. However, no model has achieved perfect performance in solving all problems, and the pros and cons of each approach remain unclear to those new to the field. Therefore, this paper aims to review deep learning algorithms that have been applied to solve molecular challenges in computational chemistry. We proposed a comprehensive categorization that encompasses two primary approaches; conventional deep learning and geometric deep learning models. This classification takes into account the distinct techniques employed by the algorithms within each approach. We present an up-to-date analysis of these algorithms, emphasizing their key features and open issues. This includes details of input descriptors, datasets used, open-source code availability, task solutions, and actual research applications, focusing on general applications rather than specific ones such as drug discovery. Furthermore, our report discusses trends and future directions in molecular algorithm design, including the input descriptors used for each deep learning model, GPU usage, training and forward processing time, model parameters, the most commonly used datasets, libraries, and optimization schemes. This information aids in identifying the most suitable algorithms for a given task. It also serves as a reference for the datasets and input data frequently used for each algorithm technique. In addition, it provides insights into the benefits and open issues of each technique, and supports the development of novel computational chemistry systems.

Title: AI-augmented clinical decision in paediatric appendicitis: can an AI-generated model improve trainees' diagnostic capability?
Year: 2023
Authors: Shikha Anas, Kasem Asem, Han Win Sabai Phyu, Wong Janice Hui Ling
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of paediatric appendicitis remains a challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations and reliance on subjective assessments. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with an expert's ''clinical sense'' has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Artificial Intelligence Pediatric Appendicitis Decision-tree (AiPAD) model in enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of trainees and compare their performance with that of an expert supervisor. Between March 2019 and October 2022, we included paediatric patients aged 0-12 years who were referred for suspected appendicitis. Trainees collected clinical findings using five predefined parameters before ordering any imaging studies. The AiPAD model, which was blinded to the surgical team, made predictions from the supervisor's and trainees' findings independently. The diagnosis verdicts of the supervisor and the trainees were statistically evaluated in comparison to the prediction of the AI model, taking into account the revealed correct diagnosis. A total of 136 cases were included, comprising 58 cases of acute appendicitis (AA) and 78 cases of non-appendicitis (NA). The supervisor's correct verdict showed 91% accuracy compared to an average of 70% for trainees. However, if trainees were enabled with AiPAD, their accuracy would improve significantly to an average of 97%. Significantly, a strong association was observed between the expert's clinical sense and the predictions generated by AiPAD.

Title: Maximum correentropy-based robust Square-root Cubature Kalman Filter for vehicular cooperative navigation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Sun Wei, Zhang Xiaotong, Ding Wei, Zhang Heming, Liu Ao
Abstract: As the core method of cooperative navigation, relative positioning plays a key role in realizing intelligent vehicle driving and vehicle self-assembling network collaboration algorithms. However, when the contamination rate of measurement noise is high, the performance of filtering will be seriously affected. To better address the filtering performance degradation problem due to noise contamination, this paper proposes a vehicular cooperative localization method based on the Maximum Correentropy Robust Square-root Cubature Kalman Filter (MCSCKF). The algorithm not only retains the advantages of Square-root Cubature Kalman Filter (SCKF) but also has strong robustness to non-Gaussian noise. The experimental results of tightly integrated vehicular cooperative navigation show that compared with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), the localization accuracy of MCSCKF is improved by 35.08% and 31.83%, respectively, which verified the effectiveness in improving the accuracy and robustness of the relative position estimation.

Title: Interlayer Phonon Coupling from Heavy and Light Sublayers in a Natural Van der Waals Superlattice.
Year: 2024
Authors: Bai Wei, Hua Yang, Nan Pengfei, Dai Shengnan, Sun Liang, Huang Xinlong, Yang Jiong, Ge Binghui, Xiao Chong, Xie Yi
Abstract: Layered compounds characterized by van der Waals gaps are often associated with relatively weak interlayer particle interactions. However, in specific scenarios, these seemingly feeble forces can exert an impact on interlayer interactions through subtle energy fluctuations, which can give rise to a diverse range of physical and chemical properties, particularly intriguing in the context of thermal transport. In this study, taking a natural superlattice composed of alternately stacked PbS and SnS<sub>2</sub> sublayers as a model, we proposed that in a superlattice, there is strong hybridization between acoustic phonons of heavy sublayers and optical phonons of light sublayers. We identified newly generated vibration modes in the superlattice, such as interlayer shear and breathing, which exhibit lower sound velocity and contribute less to heat transport compared to their parent materials, which significantly alters the thermal behaviors of the superlattice compared to its bulk counterparts. Our findings on the behavior of interlayer phonons in superlattices not only can shed light on developing functional materials with enhanced thermal dissipation capabilities but also contribute to the broader field of condensed matter physics, offering insights into various fields, including thermoelectrics and phononic devices, and may pave the way for technological advancements in these areas.

Abstract: Patients with acute coronary syndromes caused by plaque erosion might be managed conservatively without stenting. Currently, the diagnosis of plaque erosion requires an invasive imaging procedure. We sought to develop a deep learning (DL) model that enables an accurate diagnosis of plaque erosion using coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). A total of 532 CTA scans from 395 patients were used to develop a DL model: 426 CTA scans from 316 patients for training and internal validation, and 106 separate scans from 79 patients for validation. Momentum Distillation-enhanced Composite Transformer Attention (MD-CTA), a novel DL model that can effectively process the entire set of CTA scans to diagnose plaque erosion, was developed. The novel DL model, compared to the convolution neural network, showed significantly improved AUC (0.899 [0.841-0.957] vs. 0.724 [0.622-0.826]), sensitivity (87.1 [70.2-96.4] vs. 71.0 [52.0-85.8]), and specificity (85.3 [75.3-92.4] vs. 68.0 [56.2-78.3]), respectively, for the patient-level prediction. Similar results were obtained at the slice-level prediction AUC (0.897 [0.890-0.904] vs. 0.757 [0.744-0.770]), sensitivity (82.2 [79.8-84.3] vs. 68.9 [66.2-71.6]), and specificity (80.1 [79.1-81.0] vs. 67.3 [66.3-68.4]), respectively. This newly developed DL model enables an accurate CT diagnosis of plaque erosion, which might enable cardiologists to provide tailored therapy without invasive procedures.Clinical Trial Registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT04523194.

Title: The role of artificial intelligence in electrodiagnostic and neuromuscular medicine: Current state and future directions.
Year: 2023
Authors: Taha Mohamed A, Morren John A
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have ushered in a new era of technological breakthroughs in healthcare. These technologies are revolutionizing the way we utilize medical data, enabling improved disease classification, more precise diagnoses, better treatment selection, therapeutic monitoring, and highly accurate prognostication. Different ML and DL models have been used to distinguish between electromyography signals in normal individuals and those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and myopathy, with accuracy ranging from 67% to 99.5%. DL models have also been successfully applied in neuromuscular ultrasound, with the use of segmentation techniques achieving diagnostic accuracy of at least 90% for nerve entrapment disorders, and 87% for inflammatory myopathies. Other successful AI applications include prediction of treatment response, and prognostication including prediction of intensive care unit admissions for patients with myasthenia gravis. Despite these remarkable strides, significant knowledge, attitude, and practice gaps persist, including within the field of electrodiagnostic and neuromuscular medicine. In this narrative review, we highlight the fundamental principles of AI and draw parallels with the intricacies of human brain networks. Specifically, we explore the immense potential that AI holds for applications in electrodiagnostic studies, neuromuscular ultrasound, and other aspects of neuromuscular medicine. While there are exciting possibilities for the future, it is essential to acknowledge and understand the limitations of AI and take proactive steps to mitigate these challenges. This collective endeavor holds immense potential for the advancement of healthcare through the strategic and responsible integration of AI technologies.

Title: Large Casimir Flipping Torque in Quantum Trap.
Year: 2024
Authors: Jiang Zonghuiyi, Chen Fangyuan, Kou Zepu, Yin Jun, Liu Xiaofei, Guo Wanlin
Abstract: Casimir torque between parallel plates, a macroscopic quantum electrodynamics effect, is known to be induced by dielectric anisotropy and related to the rotational degree of freedom. We here reveal a different type of Casimir torque generated on a Au plate suspended in a quantum trap without recourse to materials anisotropy. As the Au plate deflects from the equilibrium plane with a nonzero flipping angle, the regions departing from and approaching the Teflon-coated Au substrate are subjected to attractive and repulsive Casimir forces, respectively, resulting in a restoring torque about the axis of flipping. For a quantum trap with an equilibrium separation of ∼10 nm, the stiffness per unit area of the Casimir flipping torque can be an order of magnitude larger than those of previously reported dielectric anisotropy-induced rotational torques at the same separation. The large Casimir flipping torque provides the possibility of designing a mechanical oscillator completely dominated by quantum and thermal fluctuations.

Abstract: The International Society of AD (ISAD) organized a roundtable on global aspects of AD at the WCD 2023 in Singapore. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) consortium, at least 171 million individuals were affected with AD in 2019, corresponding to 2.23% of the world population, with age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates that were relatively stable from 1990 to 2019. Based on the panel experience, most AD cases are mild-to-moderate. Without parallel data on disease prevalence and severity, the GBD data are difficult to interpret in many regions. This gap is particularly important in countries with limited medical infrastructure, but indirect evidence suggests a significant burden of AD in low-and-medium resource settings, especially urban areas. The Singapore roundtable was an opportunity to compare experiences in World Bank category 1 (Madagascar and Mali), 3 (Brazil, China) and 4 (Australia, Germany, Qatar, USA, Singapore, Japan) countries. The panel concluded that current AD guidelines are not adapted for low resource settings and a more pragmatic approach, as developed by WHO for skin NTDs, would be advisable for minimal access to moisturizers and topical corticosteroids. The panel also recommended prioritizing prevention studies, regardless of the level of existing resources. For disease long-term control in World Bank category 3 and most category 4 countries, the main problem is not access to drugs for most mild-to-moderate cases, but rather poor compliance due to insufficient time at visits. Collaboration with WHO, patient advocacy groups and industry may promote global change, improve capacity training and fight current inequalities. Finally, optimizing management of AD and its comorbidities needs more action at the primary care level, because reaching specialist care is merely aspirational in most settings. Primary care empowerment with store and forward telemedicine and algorithms based on augmented intelligence is a future goal.

Title: Combining physical mechanisms and deep learning models for hourly surface ozone retrieval in China.
Year: 2024
Authors: Yan Xing, Guo Yushan, Zhang Yue, Chen Jiayi, Jiang Yize, Zuo Chen, Zhao Wenji, Shi Wenzhong
Abstract: As surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) gains increasing attention, there is an urgent need for high temporal resolution and accurate O<sub>3</sub> monitoring. By taking advantage of the progress in artificial intelligence, deep learning models have been applied to satellite based O<sub>3</sub> retrieval. However, the underlying physical mechanisms that influence surface O<sub>3</sub> into model construction have rarely been considered. To overcome this issue, we considered the physical mechanisms influencing surface O<sub>3</sub> and used them to select relevant variable features for developing a novel deep learning model. We used a wide and deep model architecture to account for linear and non-linear relationships between the variables and surface O<sub>3</sub>. Using the developed model, we performed hourly inversions of surface O<sub>3</sub> retrieval over China from 2017 to 2019 (9:00-17:00, local time). The validation results based on sample-based (site-based) methods yielded an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.94 (0.86) and an RMSE of 12.79 (19.13) μg/m<sup>3</sup>, indicating the accuracy of the models. The average surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China in 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 82, 78, and 87 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. There was a diurnal pattern in surface O<sub>3</sub> in China, with levels rising significantly from 55 μg/m<sup>3</sup> at 9:00 a.m. to 96 μg/m<sup>3</sup> at 15:00. Between 15:00 and 16:00, the O<sub>3</sub> concentration remained stable at 95 μg/m<sup>3</sup> and decreased slightly thereafter (16:00-17:00). The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms of ozone and facilitate further studies on ozone monitoring, thereby enhancing our understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of ozone.

Title: Distrust before first sight? Examining knowledge- and appearance-based effects of trustworthiness on the visual consciousness of faces.
Year: 2023
Authors: Eiserbeck Anna, Enge Alexander, Rabovsky Milena, Abdel Rahman Rasha
Abstract: The present EEG study with 32 healthy participants investigated whether affective knowledge about a person influences the visual awareness of their face, additionally considering the impact of facial appearance. Faces differing in perceived trustworthiness based on appearance were associated with negative or neutral social information and shown as target stimuli in an attentional blink task. As expected, participants showed enhanced awareness of faces associated with negative compared to neutral social information. On the neurophysiological level, this effect was connected to differences in the time range of the early posterior negativity (EPN)-a component associated with enhanced attention and facilitated processing of emotional stimuli. The findings indicate that the social-affective relevance of a face based on emotional knowledge is accessed during a phase of attentional enhancement for conscious perception and can affect prioritization for awareness. In contrast, no clear evidence for influences of facial trustworthiness during the attentional blink was found.

Title: Assessing the Mechanical-to-Electrical Energy Conversion Process of a Droplet Sliding on the Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) Surface.
Year: 2024
Authors: Hu Tao, Li Xuemei, Wang Xiang, Sheng Han, Yin Jun, Guo Wanlin
Abstract: Utilizing moving droplets to generate electricity has garnered significant attention due to its high output voltage and power. However, the understanding of energy dissipation and conversion processes during droplet movement remains limited, hindering the development of effective ways to further enhance the device's performance. In this study, we developed a method to simultaneously evaluate the input mechanical energy and output electrical energy while droplets slide on a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surface to assess the energy conversion process. The influences of ion concentration, droplet volume, and contact area with PTFE on the energy conversion efficiency were investigated, suggesting optimized parameters. Moreover, by introduction of an asymmetric electric field on the PTFE surface, the input mechanical energy can be significantly reduced. In combination with the enhanced electrical output originating from improved surface charge density, the energy conversion efficiency is improved by an order of magnitude from 0.61 to 9.08%. These results shed light on strategies to improve device performance based on moving droplets.

Authors: Zhang Tingting, Zhang Lan, Wu Shiying, Wang Gongying, Huang Xianhuai, Li Weihua, Liu Chang, Kong Zhe, Li Jiansheng, Lu Rui
Abstract: In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are self-assembled onto the polyamide (PA) pore array through hydrogen bonding, resulting in and optimizing the PA/Ag 3D pore array substrates. The best surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate is obtained with a pore depth of 500 nm in the PA array, 30 nm AgNPs, at a pH of 5.0, and a 24 h assembly time. The SERS performance of the substrates is assessed using rhodamine 6G (R6G) as a probe molecule. The detection limit of the R6G molecule reaches 10<sup>-13</sup> M, and the relative standard deviation is under 20%, indicating good enhancement ability and reproducibility. Furthermore, label-free detection of pesticide contaminant diquat with a detection limit of 2.69 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M is achieved using the optimized 3D substrate, which meets environmental monitoring requirements for drinking water. The findings demonstrate that this 3D SERS substrate has promising potential for use and development in the fields of contaminant detection and chemical sensing.

Title: A Tumor-Specific Cascade-Activating Smart Prodrug System for Enhanced Targeted Therapy.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Qiwei, Jin Duo, Liu Chengbin, Shi Lili, Li Tao
Abstract: Developing intelligently targeted drugs with low side effects is urgent for cancer treatment. Toward this goal, a tumor-specific cascade-activating smart prodrug system consisting of a G-quadruplex(G4)-modulated tumor-targeted DNA vehicle and a well-designed cellular stimuli-responsive ligand-drug conjugates (LDCs) is proposed. An original "donor-acceptor" binary fluorescent ligand, with ultrahigh affinity, brightness, and photostability, is engineered to tightly bind G4 structures and significantly improve the nuclease resistance of the DNA vehicle, which serves as a bridge contributing to the construction of the prodrug system, named ApG4/LDCs. Sodium nitroprusside and doxorubicin are loaded into ApG4/LDCs in one pot and generate nitric oxide and superoxide anion in response to cancer cellular environments, which in cascade generates peroxynitrite to cause DNA damage while promoting the self-monitored drug release to achieve enhanced targeted therapy. Such a cascade activation and self-reinforcement process is executed only when the prodrug system targets the tumor tissue followed by cell uptake, showing significant antitumor efficacy and greatly weakening the damage to normal tissues. Given the unique features, the innovative strategy for prodrug design may open a new door to precision disease treatment.

Title: Conversion of Photoluminescence Blinking Types in Single Colloidal Quantum Dots.

Authors: Yang Changgang, Li Yang, Hou Xiaoqi, Zhang Mi, Zhang Guofeng, Li Bin, Guo Wenli, Han Xue, Bai Xiuqing, Li Jialu, Chen Ruiyun, Qin Chengbing, Hu Jianyong, Xiao Liantuan, Jia Suotang
Abstract: Almost all colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit undesired photoluminescence (PL) blinking, which poses a significant obstacle to their use in numerous luminescence applications. An in-depth study of the blinking behavior, along with the associated mechanisms, can provide critical opportunities for fabricating high-quality QDs for diverse applications. Here the blinking of a large series of colloidal QDs is investigated with different surface ligands, particle sizes, shell thicknesses, and compositions. It is found that the blinking behavior of single alloyed CdSe/ZnS QDs with a shell thickness of up to 2 nm undergoes an irreversible conversion from Auger-blinking to band-edge carrier blinking (BC-blinking). Contrastingly, single perovskite QDs with particle sizes smaller than their Bohr diameters exhibit reversible conversion between BC-blinking and more pronounced Auger-blinking. Changes in the effective trapping sites under different excitation conditions are found to be responsible for the blinking type conversions. Additionally, changes in shell thickness and particle size of QDs have a significant effect on the blinking type conversions due to altered wavefunction overlap between excitons and effective trapping sites. This study elucidates the discrepancies in the blinking behavior of various QD samples observed in previous reports and provides deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying diverse types of blinking.

Title: Low Power Volatile and Nonvolatile Memristive Devices from 1D MoO<sub>2</sub> -MoS<sub>2</sub> Core-Shell Heterostructures for Future Bio-Inspired Computing.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yadav Renu, Poudyal Saroj, Rajarapu Ramesh, Biswal Bubunu, Barman Prahalad Kanti, Kasiviswanathan S, Novoselov Kostya S, Misra Abhishek
Abstract: Memristors-based integrated circuits for emerging bio-inspired computing paradigms require an integrated approach utilizing both volatile and nonvolatile memristive devices. Here, an innovative architecture comprising of 1D CVD-grown core-shell heterostructures (CSHSs) of MoO<sub>2</sub> -MoS<sub>2</sub> is employed as memristors manifesting both volatile switching (with high selectivity of 10<sup>7</sup> and steep slope of 0.6 mV decade<sup>-1</sup> ) and nonvolatile switching phenomena (with I<sub>on</sub> /I<sub>off</sub> ≈10<sup>3</sup> and switching speed of 60 ns). In these CSHSs, the metallic core MoO<sub>2</sub> with high current carrying capacity provides a conformal and immaculate interface with semiconducting MoS<sub>2</sub> shells and therefore it acts as a bottom electrode for the memristors. The power consumption in volatile devices is as low as 50 pW per set transition and 0.1 fW in standby mode. Voltage-driven current spikes are observed for volatile devices while with nonvolatile memristors, key features of a biological synapse such as short/long-term plasticity and paired pulse facilitation are emulated suggesting their potential for the development of neuromorphic circuits. These CSHSs offer an unprecedented solution for the interfacial issues between metallic electrodes and the layered materials-based switching element with the prospects of developing smaller footprint memristive devices for future integrated circuits.

Title: Recyclable Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Hydrogels for Pseudocapacitor Fabrication.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiang Yan, Vázquez Ricardo Javier, McCuskey Samantha R, Yip Benjamin Rui Peng, Quek Glenn, Ohayon David, Kundukad Binu, Wang Xuehang, Bazan Guillermo C
Abstract: In alignment with widespread interest in carbon neutralization and sustainable practices, we disclose that conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) hydrogels are a type of recyclable, electrochemically stable, and environmentally friendly pseudocapacitive material for energy storage applications. By leveraging ionic-electronic coupling in a relatively fluid medium, one finds that hydrogels prepared using a fresh batch of an anionic CPE, namely, Pris-CPE-K, exhibit a specific capacitance of 32.6 ± 6.6 F g<sup>-1</sup> in 2 M NaCl and are capable of 80% (26.1 ± 6.5 F g<sup>-1</sup>) capacitance retention after 100,000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles at a current density (<i>J</i>) of 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>. We note that equilibration under a constant potential prior to GCD analysis leads to the K<sup>+</sup> counterions in the CPE exchanging with Na<sup>+</sup> and, thus, the relevant active material Pris-CPE-Na. It is possible to remove the CPE material from the electrochemical cell via extraction with water and to carry out a simple purification through dialysis to produce a recycled material, namely Re-CPE-Na. The recycling workup has no significant detrimental impact on the electrochemical performance. Specifically, Re-CPE-Na hydrogels display an initial specific capacitance of 26.3 ± 1.2 F g<sup>-1</sup> (at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and retain 77% of the capacitance after a subsequent 100,000 GCD cycles. Characterization by NMR, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopies, together with XPS and GPC measurements, revealed no change in the structure of the backbone or side chains. However, rheological measurements gave evidence of a slight loss in <i>G</i>' and <i>G</i>''. Overall, that CPE hydrogels display recyclability argues in favor of considering them as a novel materials platform for energy storage applications within an economically viable circular recycling strategy.

Title: Emergent Applications of Machine Learning for Diagnosing and Managing Appendicitis: A State-of-the-Art Review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bhandarkar Shaan, Tsutsumi Ayaka, Schneider Eric B, Ong Chin Siang, Paredes Lucero, Brackett Alexandria, Ahuja Vanita
Abstract: <b><i>Background:</i></b> Appendicitis is an inflammatory condition that requires timely and effective intervention. Despite being one of the most common surgically treated diseases, the condition is difficult to diagnose because of atypical presentations. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) imaging improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses, yet these tools bear the drawbacks of high operator dependency and radiation exposure, respectively. However, new artificial intelligence tools (such as machine learning) may be able to address these shortcomings. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We conducted a state-of-the-art review to delineate the various use cases of emerging machine learning algorithms for diagnosing and managing appendicitis in recent literature. The query ("Appendectomy" OR "Appendicitis") AND ("Machine Learning" OR "Artificial Intelligence") was searched across three databases for publications ranging from 2012 to 2022. Upon filtering for duplicates and based on our predefined inclusion criteria, 39 relevant studies were identified. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The algorithms used in these studies performed with an average accuracy of 86% (18/39), a sensitivity of 81% (16/39), a specificity of 75% (16/39), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.82 (15/39) where reported. Based on accuracy alone, the optimal model was logistic regression in 18% of studies, an artificial neural network in 15%, a random forest in 13%, and a support vector machine in 10%. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The identified studies suggest that machine learning may provide a novel solution for diagnosing appendicitis and preparing for patient-specific post-operative complications. However, further studies are warranted to assess the feasibility and advisability of implementing machine learning-based tools in clinical practice.

Title: An augmented Mendelian randomization approach provides causality of brain imaging features on complex traits in a single biobank-scale dataset.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yang Anyi, Yang Yucheng T, Zhao Xing-Ming
Abstract: Mendelian randomization (MR) is an effective approach for revealing causal risk factors that underpin complex traits and diseases. While MR has been more widely applied under two-sample settings, it is more promising to be used in one single large cohort given the rise of biobank-scale datasets that simultaneously contain genotype data, brain imaging data, and matched complex traits from the same individual. However, most existing multivariable MR methods have been developed for two-sample setting or a small number of exposures. In this study, we introduce a one-sample multivariable MR method based on partial least squares and Lasso regression (MR-PL). MR-PL is capable of considering the correlation among exposures (e.g., brain imaging features) when the number of exposures is extremely upscaled, while also correcting for winner's curse bias. We performed extensive and systematic simulations, and demonstrated the robustness and reliability of our method. Comprehensive simulations confirmed that MR-PL can generate more precise causal estimates with lower false positive rates than alternative approaches. Finally, we applied MR-PL to the datasets from UK Biobank to reveal the causal effects of 36 white matter tracts on 180 complex traits, and showed putative white matter tracts that are implicated in smoking, blood vascular function-related traits, and eating behaviors.

Title: Predicting preterm birth using explainable machine learning in a prospective cohort of nulliparous and multiparous pregnant women.
Year: 2023
Authors: Khan Wasif, Zaki Nazar, Ghenimi Nadirah, Ahmad Amir, Bian Jiang, Masud Mohammad M, Ali Nasloon, Govender Romona, Ahmed Luai A
Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB) presents a complex challenge in pregnancy, often leading to significant perinatal and long-term morbidities. "While machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown promise in PTB prediction, the lack of interpretability in existing models hinders their clinical utility. This study aimed to predict PTB in a pregnant population using ML models, identify the key risk factors associated with PTB through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and provide comprehensive explanations for these predictions to assist clinicians in providing appropriate care. This study analyzed a dataset of 3509 pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates and selected 35 risk factors associated with PTB based on the existing medical and artificial intelligence literature. Six ML algorithms were tested, wherein the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, with an area under the operator receiving curves of 0.735 and 0.723 for parous and nulliparous women, respectively. The SHAP feature attribution framework was employed to identify the most significant risk factors linked to PTB. Additionally, individual patient analysis was performed using the SHAP and the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation algorithms (LIME). The overall incidence of PTB was 11.23% (11 and 12.1% in parous and nulliparous women, respectively). The main risk factors associated with PTB in parous women are previous PTB, previous cesarean section, preeclampsia during pregnancy, and maternal age. In nulliparous women, body mass index at delivery, maternal age, and the presence of amniotic infection were the most relevant risk factors. The trained ML prediction model developed in this study holds promise as a valuable screening tool for predicting PTB within this specific population. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME analyses can assist clinicians in understanding the individualized impact of each risk factor on their patients and provide appropriate care to reduce morbidity and mortality related to PTB.

Title: Development of a robust daily soil temperature estimation in semi-arid continental climate using meteorological predictors based on computational intelligent paradigms.
Year: 2023
Authors: Alizamir Meysam, Ahmed Kaywan Othman, Kim Sungwon, Heddam Salim, Gorgij AliReza Docheshmeh, Chang Sun Woo
Abstract: Changes in soil temperature (ST) play an important role in the main mechanisms within the soil, including biological and chemical activities. For instance, they affect the microbial community composition, the speed at which soil organic matter breaks down and becomes minerals. Moreover, the growth and physiological activity of plants are directly influenced by the ST. Additionally, ST indirectly affects plant growth by influencing the accessibility of nutrients in the soil. Therefore, designing an efficient tool for ST estimating at different depths is useful for soil studies by considering meteorological parameters as input parameters, maximal air temperature, minimal air temperature, maximal air relative humidity, minimal air relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. This investigation employed various statistical metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the implemented models. These metrics encompassed the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency, and mean absolute error (MAE). Hence, this study presented several artificial intelligence-based models, MLPANN, SVR, RFR, and GPR for building robust predictive tools for daily scale ST estimation at 05, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100cm soil depths. The suggested models are evaluated at two meteorological stations (i.e., Sulaimani and Dukan) located in Kurdistan region, Iraq. Based on assessment of outcomes of this study, the suggested models exhibited exceptional predictive capabilities and comparison of the results showed that among the proposed frameworks, GPR yielded the best results for 05, 10, 20, and 100cm soil depths, with RMSE values of 1.814°C, 1.652°C, 1.773°C, and 2.891°C, respectively. Also, for 50cm soil depth, MLPANN performed the best with an RMSE of 2.289°C at Sulaimani station using the RMSE during the validation phase. Furthermore, GPR produced the most superior outcomes for 10cm, 30cm, and 50cm soil depths, with RMSE values of 1.753°C, 2.270°C, and 2.631°C, respectively. In addition, for 05cm soil depth, SVR achieved the highest level of performance with an RMSE of 1.950°C at Dukan station. The results obtained in this research confirmed that the suggested models have the potential to be effectively used as daily predictive tools at different stations and various depths.

Title: SkinViT: A transformer based method for Melanoma and Nonmelanoma classification.
Year: 2023
Authors: Khan Somaiya, Khan Ali
Abstract: Over the past few decades, skin cancer has emerged as a major global health concern. The efficacy of skin cancer treatment greatly depends upon early diagnosis and effective treatment. The automated classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma is quite challenging task due to presence of high visual similarities across different classes and variabilities within each class. According to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma utilising Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) under the Nonmelanoma class for the first time. Therefore, this research focuses on automated detection of different skin cancer types to provide assistance to the dermatologists in timely diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma patients. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have gained popularity where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to accurately classify various skin diseases. However, CNN has limitation in its ability to capture global contextual information which may lead to missing important information. In order to address this issue, this research explores the outlook attention mechanism inspired by vision outlooker, which improves important features while suppressing noisy features. The proposed SkinViT architecture integrates an outlooker block, transformer block and MLP head block to efficiently capture both fine level and global features in order to enhance the accuracy of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma classification. The proposed SkinViT method is assessed by different performance metrics such as recall, precision, classification accuracy, and F1 score. We performed extensive experiments on three datasets, Dataset1 which is extracted from ISIC2019, Dataset2 collected from various online dermatological database and Dataset3 combines both datasets. The proposed SkinViT achieved 0.9109 accuracy on Dataset1, 0.8911 accuracy on Dataset3 and 0.8611 accuracy on Dataset2. Moreover, the proposed SkinViT method outperformed other SOTA models and displayed higher accuracy compared to the previous work in the literature. The proposed method demonstrated higher performance efficiency in classification of Melanoma and Nonmelanoma dermoscopic images. This work is expected to inspire further research in implementing a system for detecting skin cancer that can assist dermatologists in timely diagnosing Melanoma and Nonmelanoma patients.

Title: Adaptive Cross-Feature Fusion Network With Inconsistency Guidance for Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yue Guanghui, Zhuo Guibin, Zhou Tianwei, Liu Weide, Wang Tianfu, Jiang Qiuping
Abstract: In the context of contemporary artificial intelligence, increasing deep learning (DL) based segmentation methods have been recently proposed for brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) via analysis of multi-modal MRI. However, known DL-based works usually directly fuse the information of different modalities at multiple stages without considering the gap between modalities, leaving much room for performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep neural network, termed ACFNet, for accurately segmenting brain tumor in multi-modal MRI. Specifically, ACFNet has a parallel structure with three encoder-decoder streams. The upper and lower streams generate coarse predictions from individual modality, while the middle stream integrates the complementary knowledge of different modalities and bridges the gap between them to yield fine prediction. To effectively integrate the complementary information, we propose an adaptive cross-feature fusion (ACF) module at the encoder that first explores the correlation information between the feature representations from upper and lower streams and then refines the fused correlation information. To bridge the gap between the information from multi-modal data, we propose a prediction inconsistency guidance (PIG) module at the decoder that helps the network focus more on error-prone regions through a guidance strategy when incorporating the features from the encoder. The guidance is obtained by calculating the prediction inconsistency between upper and lower streams and highlights the gap between multi-modal data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset show that ACFNet is competent for the BraTS task with promising results and outperforms six mainstream competing methods.

Title: Prediction of Foodborne Norovirus Outbreaks in Coastal Areas in China in 2008-2018.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Jiao, Ran Lu, Zhai Mengying, Jiang Chao, Xu Chao
Abstract: Foodborne norovirus outbreak usually poses high risks in coastal areas in China. Owing to the influence of multiple climatic factors, it demonstrates typical seasonality and the hotspots gradually expanded northwards from 2008 to 2018. However, the complex mechanism of the onset of outbreaks makes accurate prediction difficult. Thus, it is in necessity to construct a predictive model for foodborne norovirus outbreaks in coastal areas based on environmental and geographical variables. A novel predictive nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs model was developed using 11 years of environmental and foodborne norovirus outbreak data collected from coastal areas in China. Five input variables (temperature, precipitation, elevation, latitude, and longitude) were screened through stepwise regression analysis. The predicted model developed in this study was able to reproduce 88.53% of outbreaks reported to the National Public Health Emergency Event Surveillance System (PHEESS) in the model development and 100% of outbreaks reported in the independent cross-validation since the system was first launched in China. In particular, foodborne norovirus outbreaks might occur when the probability is >0.6. The findings of this study suggest that foodborne norovirus outbreaks could be accurately predicted in coastal areas in China using the developed predictive model on a daily basis. The model output is most sensitive to temperature, followed by precipitation, and locations. The application of this predictive model is promising to improve local hygiene management levels, prevent foodborne norovirus outbreaks, and reduce the disease and economic costs in coastal areas in China.

Abstract: Anxiety disorders (ADs) are a group of prevalent and destructive mental illnesses, but the current understanding of their underlying neuropathology is still unclear. Employing voxel-based morphometry (VBM), previous studies have demonstrated several common brain regions showing grey matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. However, contradictory results have been reported among these studies. Considering that different subtypes of ADs exhibit common core symptoms despite different diagnostic criteria, and previous meta-analyses have found common core GMV-altered brain regions in ADs, the present research aimed to combine the results of individual studies to identify common GMV abnormalities in ADs. Therefore, we first performed a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science on studies investigating GMV differences between patients with ADs and healthy controls (HCs). Then, the anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) was applied in this meta-analysis. A total of 24 studies (including 25 data sets) were included in the current study, and 906 patients with ADs and 1003 HCs were included. Compared with the HCs, the patients with ADs showed increased GMV in the left superior parietal gyrus, right angular gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right lingual gyrus, and decreased GMV in the bilateral insula, bilateral thalamus, left caudate, and right putamen. In conclusion, the current study has identified some abnormal GMV brain regions that are related to the pathological mechanisms of anxiety disorders. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology of ADs.

Year: 2023
Authors: Zou Renling, Zhao Liang, He Shuang, Zhou Xiaobo, Yin Xuezhi
Abstract: Decoding movement information from electroencephalogram to construct brain-computer interface has promising applications. The EEG data during the entire motor imagery (MI) period or movement execution (ME) period is generally decoded, and calculation of numerous information and massive dataset is time-consuming. In order to improve decoding efficiency, the joint topographic maps of the brain activation state of 15 subjects were studied during different periods. The results showed that the activation intensity of the preparation period in the motor imagery experiment was higher than during the exercise period, while during the exercise period, the activation intensity was higher than in the preparation period in the movement execution experiment. Hence, the wavelet neural network was used to decode the six-class movements including elbow flexion/extension, forearm pronation/supination and hand open/close in periods of MI/ME. The experimental results show that the accuracy obtained in the preparation period is the highest in the motor imagery experiment, which is 80.77%. On the other hand, the highest accuracy obtained in the exercise period of the movement execution experiment is 79.26%. It further proves that the optimized period is a key decoding factor to reduce the cost of calculation, and this new decoding method is effective to build a more intelligent brain-computer interface system.

Title: Heterogeneous decision-making dynamics of threshold-switching agents on complex networks.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhao Chengli, Zhu Yuying
Abstract: In the classical two-player decision-making scenario, individuals may have different tendencies to take a certain action, given that there exists a sufficient number of neighbors adopting a particular option. This is ubiquitous in many real-life contexts including traffic congestion, crowd evacuation, and minimal vertex cover problem. Under best-response dynamics, we investigate the decision-making behaviors of heterogeneous agents on complex networks. Results of the networked games are twofold: for networks of uniform degree distribution (e.g., the lattice) and fraction of the strategy is of a linear function of the threshold setting. Moreover, the equilibrium analysis is provided and the relationship between the equilibrium dynamics and the change of the threshold value is given quantitatively. Next, if the games are played on networks with non-uniform degree distribution (e.g., random regular and scale-free networks), influence of the threshold-switching will be weakened. Robust experiments indicate that it is not the value of the average degree, but the degree distribution that influences how the strategy evolves affected by the threshold settings. Our result shows that the decision-making behaviors can be effectively manipulated by tuning the parameters in the utility function (i.e., thresholds) of some agents for more regular network structures.

Abstract: Glycans are an essential structural component of immunoglobulin G (IgG) that modulate its structure and function. However, regulatory mechanisms behind this complex posttranslational modification are not well known. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 29 genomic regions involved in regulation of IgG glycosylation, but only a few were functionally validated. One of the key functional features of IgG glycosylation is the addition of galactose (galactosylation), a trait which was shown to be associated with ageing. We performed GWAS of IgG galactosylation (N=13,705) and identified 16 significantly associated loci, indicating that IgG galactosylation is regulated by a complex network of genes that extends beyond the galactosyltransferase enzyme that adds galactose to IgG glycans. Gene prioritization identified 37 candidate genes. Using a recently developed CRISPR/dCas9 system we manipulated gene expression of candidate genes in the <i>in vitro</i> IgG expression system. Upregulation of three genes, <i>EEF1A1, MANBA</i> and <i>TNFRSF13B</i>, changed the IgG glycome composition, which confirmed that these three genes are involved in IgG galactosylation in this <i>in vitro</i> expression system.

Title: Recent Advances in the Development of Monoclonal Antibodies and Next-Generation Antibodies.
Year: 2023
Authors: Singh Rohit, Chandley Pankaj, Rohatgi Soma
Abstract: mAbs are highly indispensable tools for diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic applications. The first technique, hybridoma technology, was based on fusion of B lymphocytes with myeloma cells, which resulted in generation of single mAbs against a specific Ag. Along with hybridoma technology, several novel and alternative methods have been developed to improve mAb generation, ranging from electrofusion to the discovery of completely novel technologies such as B cell immortalization; phage, yeast, bacterial, ribosome, and mammalian display systems; DNA/RNA encoded Abs; single B cell technology; transgenic animals; and artificial intelligence/machine learning. This commentary outlines the evolution, methodology, advantages, and limitations of various mAb production techniques. Furthermore, with the advent of next-generation Ab technologies such as single-chain variable fragments, nanobodies, bispecific Abs, Fc-engineered Abs, Ab biosimilars, Ab mimetics, and Ab-drug conjugates, the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors have become resourceful to develop highly specific mAb treatments against various diseases such as cancer and autoimmune and infectious diseases.

Title: Pupillometry reveals differences in cognitive demands of listening to face mask-attenuated speech.
Year: 2023
Authors: Carraturo Sita, McLaughlin Drew J, Peelle Jonathan E, Van Engen Kristin J
Abstract: Face masks offer essential protection but also interfere with speech communication. Here, audio-only sentences spoken through four types of masks were presented in noise to young adult listeners. Pupil dilation (an index of cognitive demand), intelligibility, and subjective effort and performance ratings were collected. Dilation increased in response to each mask relative to the no-mask condition and differed significantly where acoustic attenuation was most prominent. These results suggest that the acoustic impact of the mask drives not only the intelligibility of speech, but also the cognitive demands of listening. Subjective effort ratings reflected the same trends as the pupil data.

Title: Identifying Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy: A New Perspective from Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Yisong, Yang Longtao, Shang Youlan, Huang Yijie, Ju Chao, Zheng Hairong, Zhao Wei, Liu Jun
Abstract: Type C hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a condition characterized by brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal-systemic blood shunting, which manifests as a broad spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from minimal HE (MHE), detectable only by neuropsychological or neurophysiological assessment, to coma. Though MHE is the subclinical phase of HE, it is highly prevalent in cirrhotic patients and strongly associated with poor quality of life, high risk of overt HE, and mortality. It is, therefore, critical to identify MHE at the earliest and timely intervene, thereby minimizing the subsequent complications and costs. However, proper and sensitive diagnosis of MHE is hampered by its unnoticeable symptoms and the absence of standard diagnostic criteria. A variety of neuropsychological or neurophysiological tests have been performed to diagnose MHE. However, these tests are nonspecific and susceptible to multiple factors (eg, aging, education), thereby limiting their application in clinical practice. Thus, developing an objective, effective, and noninvasive method is imperative to help detect MHE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive technique which can produce many objective biomarkers by different imaging sequences (eg, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, DWI, rs-MRI, and arterial spin labeling), has recently shown the ability to screen MHE from NHE (non-HE) patients accurately. As advanced MRI techniques continue to emerge, more minor changes in the brain could be captured, providing new means for early diagnosis and quantitative assessment of MHE. In addition, the advancement of artificial intelligence in medical imaging also presents the potential to mine more effective diagnostic biomarkers and further improves the predictive efficiency of MHE. Taken together, advanced MRI techniques may provide a new perspective for us to identify MHE in the future. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

Title: Detection of sessile serrated adenoma using artificial intelligence-enhanced endoscopy: an Asian perspective.
Year: 2023
Authors: Soo Joycelyn Mun-Peng, Koh Frederick Hong-Xiang
Abstract: As the serrated pathway has gained prominence as an alternative colorectal carcinogenesis pathway, sessile serrated adenomas or polyps (SSA/P) have been highlighted as lesions to rule out during colonoscopy. These lesions are however morphologically difficult to detect on endoscopy and can be mistaken for hyperplastic polyps due to similar endoscopic features. With the underlying nature of rapid progression and malignant transformation, interval cancer is a likely consequence of undetected or overlooked SSA/P. Real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy via the computer-assisted detection system (CADe) is an increasingly useful tool in improving adenoma detection rate by providing a second eye during the procedure. In this article, we describe a guide through a video to illustrate the detection of SSA/P during AI-assisted colonoscopy.

Title: A review of genetic variant databases and machine learning tools for predicting the pathogenicity of breast cancer.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ahmad Rahaf M, Ali Bassam R, Al-Jasmi Fatma, Sinnott Richard O, Al Dhaheri Noura, Mohamad Mohd Saberi
Abstract: Studies continue to uncover contributing risk factors for breast cancer (BC) development including genetic variants. Advances in machine learning and big data generated from genetic sequencing can now be used for predicting BC pathogenicity. However, it is unclear which tool developed for pathogenicity prediction is most suited for predicting the impact and pathogenicity of variant effects. A significant challenge is to determine the most suitable data source for each tool since different tools can yield different prediction results with different data inputs. To this end, this work reviews genetic variant databases and tools used specifically for the prediction of BC pathogenicity. We provide a description of existing genetic variants databases and, where appropriate, the diseases for which they have been established. Through example, we illustrate how they can be used for prediction of BC pathogenicity and discuss their associated advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the tools that are specialized by training on multiple diverse datasets from different databases for the same disease have enhanced accuracy and specificity and are thereby more helpful to the clinicians in predicting and diagnosing BC as early as possible.

Title: Developments in food neonicotinoids detection: novel recognition strategies, advanced chemical sensing techniques, and recent applications.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yu Xinru, Pu Hongbin, Sun Da-Wen
Abstract: Neonicotinoid insecticides (NEOs) are a new class of neurotoxic pesticides primarily used for pest control on fruits and vegetables, cereals, and other crops after organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), carbamate pesticides (CBPs), and pyrethroid pesticides. However, chronic abuse and illegal use have led to the contamination of food and water sources as well as damage to ecological and environmental systems. Long-term exposure to NEOs may pose potential risks to animals (especially bees) and even human health. Consequently, it is necessary to develop effective, robust, and rapid methods for NEOs detection. Specific recognition-based chemical sensing has been regarded as one of the most promising detection tools for NEOs due to their excellent selectivity, sensitivity, and robust interference resistance. In this review, we introduce the novel recognition strategies-enabled chemical sensing in food neonicotinoids detection in the past years (2017-2023). The properties and advantages of molecular imprinting recognition (MIR), host-guest recognition (HGR), electron-catalyzed recognition (ECR), immune recognition (IR), aptamer recognition (AR), and enzyme inhibition recognition (EIR) in the development of NEOs sensing platforms are discussed in detail. Recent applications of chemical sensing platforms in various food products, including fruits and vegetables, cereals, teas, honey, aquatic products, and others are highlighted. In addition, the future trends of applying chemical sensing with specific recognition strategies for NEOs analysis are discussed.

Title: Wireless Photoactivated Targeted Nanosystem for Oncotherapy <i>Via</i> Synergistic Effects of Hyperthermia/Redox Stress Amplification/GSK-3β Activity Inhibition.
Year: 2024
Authors: Liang Yuan, Lei Pengpeng, An Ran, Du Pengye, Liu Shuyu, Wei Yi, Zhang Hongjie
Abstract: Highly soluble salts and gas mediated therapies are emerging antitumor strategies. However, the therapeutic efficacy remains restricted by difficulty in delivering them to the tumor site and poorly controlled release in deep tissues. Here, an intelligent wireless photoactivated targeted nanosystem is designed for delivering LiCl and H<sub>2</sub> to tumors for therapy. LiCl causes cell death by inhibiting the activity of GSK-3β. H<sub>2</sub> selectively interacts with reactive oxygen species in the tumor, leading to redox stress, which induces apoptosis. The significant heat generated by the nanosystem not only kills tumor cells but also accelerates the dissolution of LiCl and the release of H<sub>2</sub>. The rapid dissolution of LiCl leads to a surge in intracellular osmotic pressure, which further intensifies the redox stress response and enhances the efficiency of therapy. The nanosystem shows efficient tumor therapeutic capability <i>via</i> synergistic effects of hyperthermia/redox stress amplification/GSK-3β activity inhibition.

Abstract: Fifty per cent of patients with cancer require radiotherapy during their disease course, however, only 10%-40% of patients in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have access to it. A shortfall in specialised workforce has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software has been developed to automate both the delineation of anatomical target structures and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy.

Abstract: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is not only one of the most fatal forms of tuberculosis, but also a major public health concern worldwide, presenting grave clinical challenges due to its nonspecific symptoms and the urgent need for timely intervention. The severity and the rapid progression of TBM underscore the necessity of early and accurate diagnosis to prevent irreversible neurological deficits and reduce mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant primarily on clinical findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, often falter in delivering timely and conclusive results. Moreover, such methods struggle to distinguish TBM from other forms of neuroinfections, making it critical to seek advanced diagnostic solutions. Against this backdrop, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as an indispensable modality in diagnostics, owing to its unique advantages. This review provides an overview of the advancements in MRI technology, specifically emphasizing its crucial applications in the early detection and identification of complex pathological changes in TBM. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has further enhanced the transformative impact of MRI on TBM diagnostic imaging. When these cutting-edge technologies synergize with deep learning algorithms, they substantially improve diagnostic precision and efficiency. Currently, the field of TBM imaging diagnosis is undergoing a phase of technological amalgamation. The melding of MRI and AI technologies unquestionably signals new opportunities in this specialized area.

Title: Using Appetitive Motivation to Train Mice for Spatial Learning in the Barnes Maze.
Year: 2023
Authors: Tajti Brigitta Tekla, Yoon Ojin, Ernyey Aliz Judit, Gáspár Attila, Varga Bence Tamás, Gyertyán István
Abstract: The Barnes maze, a well-known spatial-learning paradigm, is based on the innate fear of rodents of large open spaces and their drive to hide. However, additional aversive stimuli (strong light and threatening sounds) are often necessary to provoke the hiding response while rendering the method cumbersome and more stressful. Our objective was to establish a Barnes maze-learning paradigm in mice using palatable food as a reward. After habituating male C57BL6/J or NMRI mice to the reward, the experimenter and the apparatus, either a slow (2 trials/day) or a massive conditioning schedule (4 trials/day), was run. Acquisition training was carried out until mice could locate the reward box with a maximum of one hole error. Then, the box was replaced to another location (reversal phase). Mice needed to relearn the new position with the same criterion. One week later, retention trials were performed. Both strains could reach the learning criteria; in the massive training within a shorter period. Spatial memory was demonstrated in the reversal and retention trials. Our results show that palatable food can be used as an efficient motivator to acquire allocentric navigation in the Barnes maze with the additional advantage of being less stressful.

Title: Learning-based intelligent trajectory planning for auto navigation of magnetic robots.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kou Yuanshi, Liu Xurui, Ma Xiaotian, Xiang Yuanzhuo, Zang Jianfeng
Abstract: <b>Introduction:</b> Electromagnetically controlled small-scale robots show great potential in precise diagnosis, targeted delivery, and minimally invasive surgery. The automatic navigation of such robots could reduce human intervention, as well as the risk and difficulty of surgery. However, it is challenging to build a precise kinematics model for automatic robotic control because the controlling process is affected by various delays and complex environments. <b>Method:</b> Here, we propose a learning-based intelligent trajectory planning strategy for automatic navigation of magnetic robots without kinematics modeling. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed to establish a global mapping relationship between the current sequence in the electromagnetic actuation system and the trajectory coordinates. <b>Result:</b> We manually control the robot to move on a curved path 50 times to form the training database to train the LSTM network. The trained LSTM network is validated to output the current sequence for automatically controlling the magnetic robot to move on the same curved path and the tortuous and branched new paths in simulated vascular tracks. <b>Discussion:</b> The proposed trajectory planning strategy is expected to impact the clinical applications of robots.

Title: A deep learning model to predict Ki-67 positivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Year: 2024
Authors: Martino Francesco, Ilardi Gennaro, Varricchio Silvia, Russo Daniela, Di Crescenzo Rosa Maria, Staibano Stefania, Merolla Francesco
Abstract: Anatomical pathology is undergoing its third revolution, transitioning from analogical to digital pathology and incorporating new artificial intelligence technologies into clinical practice. Aside from classification, detection, and segmentation models, predictive models are gaining traction since they can impact diagnostic processes and laboratory activity, lowering consumable usage and turnaround time. Our research aimed to create a deep-learning model to generate synthetic Ki-67 immunohistochemistry from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images. We used 175 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) from the University Federico II's Pathology Unit's archives to train our model to generate 4 Tissue Micro Arrays (TMAs). We sectioned one slide from each TMA, first stained with H&E and then re-stained with anti-Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC). In digitised slides, cores were disarrayed, and the matching cores of the 2 stained were aligned to construct a dataset to train a Pix2Pix algorithm to convert H&E images to IHC. Pathologists could recognise the synthetic images in only half of the cases in a specially designed likelihood test. Hence, our model produced realistic synthetic images. We next used QuPath to quantify IHC positivity, achieving remarkable levels of agreement between genuine and synthetic IHC. Furthermore, a categorical analysis employing 3 Ki-67 positivity cut-offs (5%, 10%, and 15%) revealed high positive-predictive values. Our model is a promising tool for collecting Ki-67 positivity information directly on H&E slides, reducing laboratory demand and improving patient management. It is also a valuable option for smaller laboratories to easily and quickly screen bioptic samples and prioritise them in a digital pathology workflow.

Title: Dynamic functional connectivity analysis with temporal convolutional network for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder identification.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Mingliang, Zhu Lingyao, Li Xizhi, Pan Yong, Li Long
Abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), which can capture the abnormality of brain activity over time in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, has a natural advantage in revealing the abnormal mechanism of brain activity in patients with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Several deep learning methods have been proposed to learn dynamic changes from rs-fMRI for FC analysis, and achieved superior performance than those using static FC. However, most existing methods only consider dependencies of two adjacent timestamps, which is limited when the change is related to the course of many timestamps.

Title: Two-stage video-based convolutional neural networks for adult spinal deformity classification.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chen Kaixu, Asada Tomoyuki, Ienaga Naoto, Miura Kousei, Sakashita Kotaro, Sunami Takahiro, Kadone Hideki, Yamazaki Masashi, Kuroda Yoshihiro
Abstract: Assessment of human gait posture can be clinically effective in diagnosing human gait deformities early in life. Currently, two methods-static and dynamic-are used to diagnose adult spinal deformity (ASD) and other spinal disorders. Full-spine lateral standing radiographs are used in the standard static method. However, this is a static assessment of joints in the standing position and does not include information on joint changes when the patient walks. Careful observation of long-distance walking can provide a dynamic assessment that reveals an uncompensated posture; however, this increases the workload of medical practitioners. A three-dimensional (3D) motion system is proposed for the dynamic method. Although the motion system successfully detected dynamic posture changes, access to the facilities was limited. Therefore, a diagnostic approach that is facility-independent, has low practice flow, and does not involve patient contact is required.

Title: AI/ML advances in non-small cell lung cancer biomarker discovery.
Year: 2023
Authors: Çalışkan Minal, Tazaki Koichi
Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women, representing approximately 25% of cancer fatalities each year. The treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly evolving due to the progress made in biomarker-driven targeted therapies. While advancements in targeted treatments have improved survival rates for NSCLC patients with actionable biomarkers, long-term survival remains low, with an overall 5-year relative survival rate below 20%. Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms have shown promise in biomarker discovery, yet NSCLC-specific studies capturing the clinical challenges targeted and emerging patterns identified using AI/ML approaches are lacking. Here, we employed a text-mining approach and identified 215 studies that reported potential biomarkers of NSCLC using AI/ML algorithms. We catalogued these studies with respect to BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) biomarker sub-types and summarized emerging patterns and trends in AI/ML-driven NSCLC biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our comprehensive review will contribute to the current understanding of AI/ML advances in NSCLC biomarker research and provide an important catalogue that may facilitate clinical adoption of AI/ML-derived biomarkers.

Title: Automated sign language detection and classification using reptile search algorithm with hybrid deep learning.
Year: 2024
Authors: Alsolai Hadeel, Alsolai Leen, Al-Wesabi Fahd N, Othman Mahmoud, Rizwanullah Mohammed, Abdelmageed Amgad Atta
Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) contains the capability to convert sign language gestures into spoken or written language. This technology is helpful for deaf persons or hard of hearing by providing them with a way to interact with people who do not know sign language. It is also be utilized for automatic captioning in live events and videos. There are distinct methods of SLR comprising deep learning (DL), computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML). One general approach utilises cameras for capturing the signer's hand and body movements and processing the video data for recognizing the gestures. One of challenges with SLR comprises the variability in sign language through various cultures and individuals, the difficulty of certain signs, and require for realtime processing. This study introduces an Automated Sign Language Detection and Classification using Reptile Search Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning (SLDC-RSAHDL). The presented SLDC-RSAHDL technique detects and classifies different types of signs using DL and metaheuristic optimizers. In the SLDC-RSAHDL technique, MobileNet feature extractor is utilized to produce feature vectors, and its hyperparameters can be adjusted by manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) technique. For sign language classification, the SLDC-RSAHDL technique applies HDL model, which incorporates the design of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). At last, the RSA was exploited for the optimal hyperparameter selection of the HDL model, which resulted in an improved detection rate. The experimental result analysis of the SLDC-RSAHDL technique on sign language dataset demonstrates the improved performance of the SLDC-RSAHDL system over other existing DL techniques.

Title: Generalizability of an acute kidney injury prediction model across health systems.
Year: 2022
Authors: Cao Jie, Zhang Xiaosong, Shahinian Vahakn, Yin Huiying, Steffick Diane, Saran Rajiv, Crowley Susan, Mathis Michael, Nadkarni Girish N, Heung Michael, Singh Karandeep
Abstract: Delays in the identification of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients are a major barrier to the development of effective interventions to treat AKI. A recent study by Tomasev and colleagues at DeepMind described a model that achieved a state-of-the-art performance in predicting AKI up to 48 hours in advance.<sup>1</sup> Because this model was trained in a population of US Veterans that was 94% male, questions have arisen about its reproducibility and generalizability. In this study, we aimed to reproduce key aspects of this model, trained and evaluated it in a similar population of US Veterans, and evaluated its generalizability in a large academic hospital setting. We found that the model performed worse in predicting AKI in females in both populations, with miscalibration in lower stages of AKI and worse discrimination (a lower area under the curve) in higher stages of AKI. We demonstrate that while this discrepancy in performance can be largely corrected in non-Veterans by updating the original model using data from a sex-balanced academic hospital cohort, the worse model performance persists in Veterans. Our study sheds light on the importance of reproducing artificial intelligence studies, and on the complexity of discrepancies in model performance in subgroups that cannot be explained simply on the basis of sample size.

Title: Reviewing the evolutive ACQ-to-AIE transformation of photosensitizers for phototheranostics.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhu Wei, Huang Lin, Wu Chao, Liu Lingli, Li Haoxuan
Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents an emerging noninvasive treatment technique for cancers and various nonmalignant diseases, including infections. During the process of PDT, the physical and chemical properties of photosensitizers (PSs) critically determine the effectiveness of PDT. Traditional PSs have made great progress in clinical applications. One of the challenges is that traditional PSs suffer from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) due to their discotic structures. Recently, aggregation-induced emission PSs (AIE-PSs) with a twisted propeller-shaped conformation have been widely concerned because of high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency, strong fluorescence efficiency, and resistance to photobleaching. However, AIE-PSs also have some disadvantages, such as short absorption wavelengths and insufficient molar absorption coefficient. When the advantages and disadvantages of AIE-PSs and ACQ-PSs are complementary, combining ACQ-PSs and AIE-PSs is a "win-to-win" strategy. As far as we know, the conversion of traditional representative ACQ-PSs to AIE-PSs for phototheranostics has not been reviewed. In the review, we summarize the recent progress on the ACQ-to-AIE transformation of PSs and the strategies to achieve desirable theranostic applications. The review would be helpful to design more efficient ACQ-AIE-PSs in the future and to accelerate the development and clinical application of PDT.

Year: 2023
Authors: Kim Tae Won
Abstract: It aims to explore ChatGPT's (GPT-3.5 version) functionalities, including reinforcement learning, diverse applications, and limitations. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. The chatbot's applications span education, programming, content generation, and more, demonstrating its versatility. ChatGPT can enhance education by creating assignments and offering personalized feedback, as shown by its notable performance in medical exams and the USMLE. However, concerns include plagiarism, reliability, and educational disparities. It aids in various research tasks, from design to writing, and has shown proficiency in summarizing and suggesting titles. Its use in scientific writing and language translation is promising, but professional oversight is needed for accuracy and originality. It assists in programming tasks like writing code, debugging, and guiding installation and updates. It offers diverse applications, from cheering up individuals to generating creative content like essays, news articles, and business plans. ChatGPT, unlike search engines, provides interactive, generative responses and understands context, making it more akin to human conversation. These characteristics are contrasted with conventional search engines' keyword-based, non-interactive nature. ChatGPT has limitations, such as potential bias, dependence on outdated data, and revenue generation challenges. Despite these issues, ChatGPT is seen as a transformative AI tool poised to redefine the future of generative technology. In conclusion, advancements in AI, like ChatGPT, are altering how knowledge is acquired and applied, marking a shift from search engines to creativity engines. This transformation highlights the increasing importance of AI literacy and the ability to utilize AI in various life aspects effectively.

Title: Psychometrics in experimental psychology: A case for calibration.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bach Dominik R
Abstract: Psychometrics is historically grounded in the study of individual differences. Consequently, common metrics such as quantitative validity and reliability require between-person variance in a psychological variable to be meaningful. Experimental psychology, in contrast, deals with variance between treatments, and experiments often strive to minimise within-group person variance. In this article, I ask whether and how psychometric evaluation can be performed in experimental psychology. A commonly used strategy is to harness between-person variance in the treatment effect. Using simulated data, I show that this approach can be misleading when between-person variance is low, and in the face of methods variance. I argue that this situation is common in experimental psychology, because low between-person variance is desirable, and because methods variance is no more problematic in experimental settings than any other source of between-person variance. By relating validity and reliability with the corresponding concepts in measurement science outside psychology, I show how experiment-based calibration can serve to compare the psychometric quality of different measurement methods in experimental psychology.

Title: Mpox (formerly monkeypox): pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lu Junjie, Xing Hui, Wang Chunhua, Tang Mengjun, Wu Changcheng, Ye Fan, Yin Lijuan, Yang Yang, Tan Wenjie, Shen Liang
Abstract: In 2022, a global outbreak of Mpox (formerly monkeypox) occurred in various countries across Europe and America and rapidly spread to more than 100 countries and regions. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of the Mpox virus. Consequently, nations intensified their efforts to explore treatment strategies aimed at combating the infection and its dissemination. Nevertheless, the available therapeutic options for Mpox virus infection remain limited. So far, only a few numbers of antiviral compounds have been approved by regulatory authorities. Given the high mutability of the Mpox virus, certain mutant strains have shown resistance to existing pharmaceutical interventions. This highlights the urgent need to develop novel antiviral drugs that can combat both drug resistance and the potential threat of bioterrorism. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive literature on the pathophysiology and treatment of Mpox. To address this issue, we conducted a review covering the physiological and pathological processes of Mpox infection, summarizing the latest progress of anti-Mpox drugs. Our analysis encompasses approved drugs currently employed in clinical settings, as well as newly identified small-molecule compounds and antibody drugs displaying potential antiviral efficacy against Mpox. Furthermore, we have gained valuable insights from the process of Mpox drug development, including strategies for repurposing drugs, the discovery of drug targets driven by artificial intelligence, and preclinical drug development. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on Mpox.

Year: 2023
Authors: Li Xu-Hui, Liao Jian-Peng, Chen Mu-Kun, Gao Kuang, Wang Yong-Bo, Yan Si-Yu, Huang Qiao, Wang Yun-Yun, Shi Yue-Xian, Hu Wen-Bin, Jin Ying-Hui
Abstract: Implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) is a complex and challenging task. Computer technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), has been explored to promote the CPG implementation. This study has reviewed the main domains where computer technology and AI has been applied to CPG implementation. PubMed, Embase, Web of science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, WanFang DATA, VIP database, and China Biology Medicine disc database were searched from inception to December 2021. Studies involving the utilization of computer technology and AI to promote the implementation of CPGs were eligible for review. A total of 10429 published articles were identified, 117 met the inclusion criteria. 21 (17.9%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to classify or extract the relative content of CPGs, such as recommendation sentence, condition-action sentences. 47 (40.2%) focused on the utilization of computer technology to represent guideline knowledge to make it understandable by computer. 15 (12.8%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to verify the relative content of CPGs, such as conciliation of multiple single-disease guidelines for comorbid patients. 34 (29.1%) focused on the utilization of AI techniques to integrate guideline knowledge into different resources, such as clinical decision support systems. We conclude that the application of computer technology and AI to CPG implementation mainly concentrated on the guideline content classification and extraction, guideline knowledge representation, guideline knowledge verification, and guideline knowledge integration. The AI methods used for guideline content classification and extraction were pattern-based algorithm and machine learning. In guideline knowledge representation, guideline knowledge verification, and guideline knowledge integration, computer techniques of knowledge representation were the most used.

Title: Core-Sheath Heterogeneous Interlocked Conductive Fiber Enables Smart Textile for Personalized Healthcare and Thermal Management.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chen Xiyu, He Yifan, Tian Mingwei, Qu Lijun, Fan Tingting, Miao Jinlei
Abstract: Whereas thermal comfort and healthcare management during long-term wear are essentially required for wearable system, simultaneously achieving them remains challenge. Herein, a highly comfortable and breathable smart textile for personal healthcare and thermal management is developed, via assembling stimuli-responsive core-sheath dual network that silver nanowires(AgNWs) core interlocked graphene sheath induced by MXene. Small MXene nanosheets with abundant groups is proposed as a novel "dispersant" to graphene according to "like dissolves like" theory, while simultaneously acting as "cross-linker" between AgNWs and graphene networks by filling the voids between them. The core-sheath heterogeneous interlocked conductive fiber induced by MXene "cross-linking" exhibits a reliable response to various mechanical/electrical/light stimuli, even under large mechanical deformations(100%). The core-sheath conductive fiber-enabled smart textile can adapt to movements of human body seamlessly, and convert these mechanical deformations into character signals for accurate healthcare monitoring with rapid response(440 ms). Moreover, smart textile with excellent Joule heating and photothermal effect exhibits instant thermal energy harvesting/storage during the stimuli-response process, which can be developed as self-powered thermal management and dynamic camouflage when integrated with phase change and thermochromic layer. The smart fibers/textiles with core-sheath heterogeneous interlocked structures hold great promise in personalized healthcare and thermal management.

Year: 2023
Authors: Qiao Wen-Cheng, Qiao Hongwei, Wang Xue Lu, Xu Haojie, Xu Fanchen, Sun Zhihua, Gao Hongchang, Yao Ye-Feng
Abstract: 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have become one of the hottest research topics due to their excellent environmental stability and unique optoelectronic properties. Recently, the ferroelectricity and thermochromism of 2D OIHPs have attracted increasing interests. Integrating ferroelectricity and thermochromism into perovskites can significantly promote the development of multichannel intelligent devices. Here, a novel 2D Dion-Jacobson OIHP of the formula (3AMP)PbI<sub>4</sub> (where 3AMP is 3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium) is reported, which has a remarkable spontaneous polarization value (Ps) of 15.6 µC cm<sup>-2</sup> and interesting thermochromism. As far it is known, such a large Ps value is the highest for 2D OIHPs recorded so far. These findings will inspire further exploration and application of multifunctional perovskites.

Title: Dark septate endophyte inoculation enhances antioxidant activity in Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus under heat stress.
Year: 2023
Authors: Bi Yinli, Xue Zike
Abstract: The influence of dark septate endophytic (DSE) on the antioxidant activity of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus under heat stress was investigated. A. membranaceus plants, with or without DSE inoculation, were grown at 28°C for 8 weeks in a greenhouse and subsequently subjected to heat stress conditions (42°C) in an artificial climate chamber. DSE inoculation significantly decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content during the initial three days of heat stress. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) of A. membranaceus leaves were significantly enhanced by DSE inoculation under heat stress, with SOD activities being 63-81% higher than in other treatments. The glutathione (GSH) and putrescine (Put) contents accumulated significantly on the third day under heat stress with DSE inoculation. Additionally, the contents of soluble sugars and proline (Pro) exhibited significant increases on the seventh day of heat stress and were 33-55% and 81-83% higher than in other treatments, respectively. Three-way ANOVA shows that DSE inoculation under heat stress exerted a significant impact on MDA. Multivariate linear regression and structural equality modelling (SEM) further show that the interaction among these antioxidants significantly decreased MDA content and maintained the normal function of cell membranes. In conclusion, DSE inoculation enhanced the heat tolerance of A. membranaceus by boosting its antioxidant capacity and reducing MDA production. This study highlights the potential of utilizing DSE as a strategy to enhance plant heat tolerance.

Title: Enhanced Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulation with a Smoothed Hybrid Potential Using a Neural Network Model.
Year: 2024
Authors: Kanada Ryo, Tokuhisa Atsushi, Nagasaka Yusuke, Okuno Shingo, Amemiya Koichiro, Chiba Shuntaro, Bekker Gert-Jan, Kamiya Narutoshi, Kato Koichiro, Okuno Yasushi
Abstract: In all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the rugged energy profile of the force field makes it challenging to reproduce spontaneous structural changes in biomolecules within a reasonable calculation time. Existing coarse-grained (CG) models, in which the energy profile is set to a global minimum around the initial structure, are unsuitable to explore the structural dynamics between metastable states far away from the initial structure without any bias. In this study, we developed a new hybrid potential composed of an artificial intelligence (AI) potential and minimal CG potential related to the statistical bond length and excluded volume interactions to accelerate the transition dynamics while maintaining the protein character. The AI potential is trained by energy matching using a diverse structural ensemble sampled via multicanonical (Mc) MD simulation and the corresponding AA force field energy, profile of which is smoothed by energy minimization. By applying the new methodology to chignolin and TrpCage, we showed that the AI potential can predict the AA energy with significantly high accuracy, as indicated by a correlation coefficient (<i>R</i>-value) between the true and predicted energies exceeding 0.89. In addition, we successfully demonstrated that CGMD simulation based on the smoothed hybrid potential can significantly enhance the transition dynamics between various metastable states while preserving protein properties compared to those obtained with conventional CGMD and AAMD.

Title: Design of a high-power collimating optical system based on Fresnel lenses.
Year: 2023
Authors: Sun Chang Cheng, Zhang Yun Cui, Wang Yan, Chen Ai Lin, Xu Zhe, Zou Yanqiu, Xu Jiyu, Wang Shuai
Abstract: In light-emitting diode (LED) illumination (e.g., LED maritime lighting for ships), creating a uniform light environment for optical systems is an important challenge. In this study, we present a high-power collimating system based on Fresnel lenses, which allows high-brightness LED illumination in the earlier-mentioned remote distance. The work presented in this article focuses on improving the power, compacting the optical structure, and promoting the brightness of the spot. To prove the claims, the system with a total power of 1 kW is designed. The system consists of a 27 W LED array, a freeform surface lens array, and a confocal Fresnel lens array. In comparison with the traditional optical system, the optical structure shortens from 390 to 120 mm, and the divergent angle decreases from 3° to 2 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics><mrow><mo>°</mo></mrow> <annotation>$$ {}^{{}^{\circ}} $$</annotation></semantics> </math> . Meanwhile, the illuminance of the system is obtained as high as 230 lx at the near field of 200 m and 3.0 lx at the far field of 1.5 nautical miles. This new method provides a practical and effective way to solve the problem of low power, insufficient illuminance, and long optical structure for LED array illumination, which is suitable for remote illumination and guidance of ships.

Title: Antimicrobial peptides: An alternative to traditional antibiotics.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ji Shuaiqi, An Feiyu, Zhang Taowei, Lou Mengxue, Guo Jiawei, Liu Kexin, Zhu Yi, Wu Junrui, Wu Rina
Abstract: As antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes continue to emerge, the identification of effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics has become a pressing issue. Antimicrobial peptides are favored for their safety, low residue, and low resistance properties, and their unique antimicrobial mechanisms show significant potential in combating antibiotic resistance. However, the high production cost and weak activity of antimicrobial peptides limit their application. Moreover, traditional laboratory methods for identifying and designing new antimicrobial peptides are time-consuming and labor-intensive, hindering their development. Currently, novel technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) are being employed to develop and design new antimicrobial peptide resources, offering new opportunities for the advancement of antimicrobial peptides. This article summarizes the basic characteristics and antimicrobial mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides, as well as their advantages and limitations, and explores the application of AI in antimicrobial peptides prediction amd design. This highlights the crucial role of AI in enhancing the efficiency of antimicrobial peptide research and provides a reference for antimicrobial drug development.

Title: Coarse-to-fine registration and time-intensity curves constraint for liver DCE-MRI synthesis.
Year: 2024
Authors: Sun Yuhang, Gu Yuning, Shi Feng, Liu Jiameng, Li Guoqiang, Feng Qianjin, Shen Dinggang
Abstract: Image registration plays a crucial role in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), used as a fundamental step for the subsequent diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors. However, the registration process encounters significant challenges due to the substantial intensity changes observed among different time points, resulting from the injection of contrast agents. Furthermore, previous studies have often overlooked the alignment of small structures, such as tumors and vessels. In this work, we propose a novel DCE-MRI registration framework that can effectively align the DCE-MRI time series. Specifically, our DCE-MRI registration framework consists of two steps, i.e., a de-enhancement synthesis step and a coarse-to-fine registration step. In the de-enhancement synthesis step, a disentanglement network separates DCE-MRI images into a content component representing the anatomical structures and a style component indicating the presence or absence of contrast agents. This step generates synthetic images where the contrast agents are removed from the original images, alleviating the negative effects of intensity changes on the subsequent registration process. In the registration step, we utilize a coarse registration network followed by a refined registration network. These two networks facilitate the estimation of both the coarse and refined displacement vector fields (DVFs) in a pairwise and groupwise registration manner, respectively. In addition, to enhance the alignment accuracy for small structures, a voxel-wise constraint is further conducted by assessing the smoothness of the time-intensity curves (TICs). Experimental results on liver DCE-MRI demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, offering more robust and accurate alignment results.

Title: Microbial biofilms for self-powered noncontact sensing.
Year: 2024
Authors: Ma Yongji, Li Bin, Ren Guoping, Wang Zhao, Zhou Shungui, Hu Qichang, Rensing Christopher
Abstract: Noncontact sensing technology plays a vital role in the intelligent human-machine interface, as the essential medium for exchanging information between human and electronic devices. To date, several inorganic materials-based noncontact sensing techniques have been used to accurately detect touch, electrical property, and physical motion. However, limited available materials, dependence on additional power supplies, and poor power production performance, have seriously obstructed the practical applications of noncontact sensing technology. Here, we developed simple self-powered noncontact sensors (SNSs) assembled using a typical G. sulfurreducens biofilm as the core component. In noncontact mode, the sensor demonstrated excellent self-powered sensing performance with maximum voltage output of 10 V and a current of 60 nA, a maximum sensing range of 40 cm which is the farthest reported to date. Depending on its excellent sensing characteristic, the SNSs was used to monitor human breathing in this work. Furthermore, an array of united SNSs was able to localize external electric fields and effectively extend the sensing area by increasing the number of devices. Compared to traditional inorganic materials, microbial biofilms have the advantages of wide existence, self-proliferation, low cost, environmental friendliness, and ultra-fast self-healing property (seconds level). The proposed biofilm SNSs in our work provides new insights for noncontact power generation of biomaterials and self-driven sensing.

Title: Effect of interface layer on the enhancement of thermal conductivity of SiC-Water nanofluids: Molecular dynamics simulation.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhu Yandong, Chen Hui, Zhang Jingjie, Xiao Guangchun, Yi Mingdong, Chen Zhaoqiang, Xu Chonghai
Abstract: To investigate the impact of interfacial layer effects on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids and the microscopic mechanisms of enhanced thermal conductivity, this study employed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to compute the thermal conductivity, number density, radial distribution function, and mean square displacement distribution of SiC nanofluids. The impact of nanoparticle volume fraction and particle size parameters on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids and the structure of interfacial adsorption layers was discussed. The simulation calculation results show that the coefficient of thermal conductivity of nanofluid is positively related to the volume fraction of nanoparticles, increasing from 0.6529 W/(m·K) to 0.8159 W/(m·K), and the enhancement of thermal conductivity by the volume fraction can be up to 33.97 %. The thermal conductivity is inversely correlated with the change in particle size, and the maximum improvement in thermal conductivity by particle size can reach up to 12.05 %. The simulated results of the thermal conductivity of nanofluid are almost consistent with the predicted results of the Yu&Choi model, and the error is controlled within 5 %. Simultaneously, the thickness of the interfacial adsorption layer decreases with an increase in particle size. This reduction arises due to larger particles having a smaller specific surface area, resulting in fewer particle surfaces covered by the interface layer. Moreover, the impact of particle size on the arrangement and affinity of molecules within the interface layer contributes to this decrease. Overall, interface layer effects exhibit a dual impact on the thermal conduction of nanofluids. The structured formation and high-density distribution of the adsorption layer contribute to enhanced heat transfer, while thermal resistance between nanoparticle surfaces and the fluid restricts heat transmission.

Title: Discovering Nature's shield: Metabolomic insights into green zinc oxide nanoparticles Safeguarding Brassica parachinensis L. from cadmium stress.
Year: 2023
Authors: Ali Shahid, Bai Yongsheng, Zhang Junliang, Zada Shah, Khan Naeem, Hu Zhangli, Tang Yulin
Abstract: Heavy metal cadmium (Cd) hinders plants' growth and productivity by causing different morphological and physiological changes. Nanoparticles (NPs) are promising for raising plant yield and reducing Cd toxicity. Nonetheless, the fundamental mechanism of nanoparticle-interfered Cd toxicity in Brassica parachineses L. remains unknown. A novel ZnO nanoparticle (ZnO-NPs) was synthesized using a microalgae strain (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) through a green process and characterized by different standard parameters through TEM, EDX, and XRD. This study examines the effect of different concentrations of ZnO-NPs (50 and 100 mgL<sup>-1</sup>) in B. parachineses L. under Cd stress through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics profiling. In the presence of Cd toxicity, foliar spraying with ZnO-NPs raised Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mg levels in the roots and/or leaves, improved seedling development, as demonstrated by increased plant height, root length, and shoot and root fresh weight. Furthermore, the ZnO-NPs significantly enhanced the photosynthetic pigments and changed the antioxidant activities of the Cd-treated plants. Based on a metabolomics analysis, 481 untargeted metabolites were accumulated in leaves under normal and Cd-stressed conditions. These metabolites were highly enriched in producing organic acids, amino acids, glycosides, flavonoids, nucleic acids, and vitamin biosynthesis. Surprisingly, ZnO-NPs restored approximately 60% of Cd stress metabolites to normal leaf levels. Our findings suggest that green synthesized ZnO-NPs can balance ions' absorption, modulate the antioxidant activities, and restore more metabolites associated with plant growth to their normal levels under Cd stress. It can be applied as a plant growth regulator to alleviate heavy metal toxicity and improve crop yield in heavy metal-contaminated regions.

Title: Computational and AI-driven 3D structural analysis of human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoproteins E5, E6, and E7 reveal significant divergence of HPV E5 between low-risk and high-risk genotypes.
Year: 2024
Authors: Jones Riley N, Miyauchi Sayuri, Roy Souvick, Boutros Nathalie, Mayadev Jyoti S, Mell Loren K, Califano Joseph A, Venuti Aldo, Sharabi Andrew B
Abstract: There are over 220 identified genotypes of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the HPV genome encodes 3 major oncogenes, E5, E6, and E7. Conservation and divergence in protein sequence and function between low-risk versus high-risk oncogenic HPV genotypes has not been fully characterized. Here, we used modern computational and structural folding algorithms to perform a comparative analysis of HPV E5, E6, and E7 between multiple low risk and high risk genotypes. We first identified significantly greater sequence divergence in E5 between low- and high-risk genotypes compared to E6 and E7. Next, we used AlphaFold to model the structure of papillomavirus proteins and complexes with high confidence, including some with no established consensus structure. We observed that HPV E5, but not E6 or E7, had a dramatically different 3D structure between low-risk and high-risk genotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of HPV proteins using Alphafold artificial intelligence (AI) system. The marked differences in E5 sequence and structure in high-risk HPVs may contribute in important and underappreciated ways to the development of HPV-associated cancers.

Title: Computational Design of Low Melting Eutectics of Molten Salts: A Combined Machine Learning and Thermodynamic Modeling Approach.
Year: 2024
Authors: Ravichandran Ashwin, Honrao Shreyas, Xie Stephen, Fonseca Eric, Lawson John W
Abstract: We develop a computational framework combining thermodynamic and machine learning models to predict the melting temperatures of molten salt eutectic mixtures (<i>T</i><sub>eut</sub>). The model shows an accuracy of ∼6% (mean absolute percentage error) over the entire data set. Using this approach, we screen millions of combinatorial eutectics ranging from binary to hexanary, predict new mixtures, and propose design rules that lead to low <i>T</i><sub>eut</sub>. We show that heterogeneity in molecular sizes, quantified by the molecular volume of the components, and mixture configurational entropy, quantified by the number of mixture components, are important factors that can be exploited to design low <i>T</i><sub>eut</sub> mixtures. While predicting eutectic composition with existing techniques had proved challenging, we provide some preliminary models for estimating the compositions. The high-throughput screening technique presented here is essential to design novel mixtures for target applications and efficiently navigate the vast design space of the eutectic mixtures.

Title: Intelligent leaching rare earth elements from waste fluorescent lamps.
Year: 2024
Authors: Niu Bo, E Shanshan, Wang Xiaomin, Xu Zhenming, Qin Yufei
Abstract: Rare earth elements (REEs), one of the global key strategic resources, are widely applied in electronic information and national defense, etc. The sharply increasing demand for REEs leads to their overexploitation and environmental pollution. Recycling REEs from their second resources such as waste fluorescent lamps (WFLs) is a win-win strategy for REEs resource utilization and environmental production. Pyrometallurgy pretreatment combined with acid leaching is proven as an efficient approach to recycling REEs from WFLs. Unfortunately, due to the uncontrollable components of wastes, many trials were required to obtain the optimal parameters, leading to a high cost of recovery and new environmental risks. This study applied machine learning (ML) to build models for assisting the leaching of six REEs (Tb, Y, Eu, La, and Gd) from WFLs, only needing the measurement of particle size and composition of the waste feed. The feature importance analysis of 40 input features demonstrated that the particle size, Mg, Al, Fe, Sr, Ca, Ba, and Sb content in the waste feed, the pyrometallurgical and leaching parameters have important effects on REEs leaching. Furthermore, their influence rules on different REEs leaching were revealed. Finally, some verification experiments were also conducted to demonstrate the reliability and practicality of the model. This study can quickly get the optimal parameters and leaching efficiency for REEs without extensive optimization experiments, which significantly reduces the recovery cost and environmental risks. Our work carves a path for the intelligent recycling of strategic REEs from waste.

Title: Crosstalk-Free Position Mapping for One-Step Reconstruction of Surface Topological Information via Eigenfrequency-Registered Wearable Interface.
Year: 2024
Authors: Fang Dan, Ding Sen, Zhou Qian, Zhao Dazhe, Zhong Junwen, Zhou Bingpu
Abstract: Exploring flexible tactile sensors capable of recognizing surface information is significant for the development of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, soft robotics, and human-machine interactions (HMI). However, it is still a challenge for current tactile sensors to efficiently recognize the surface pattern information while maintaining the simplicity of the overall system. In this study, cantilever beam-like magnetized micropillars (MMPs) with height gradients are assembled as a position-registered array for rapid recognition of surface pattern information. After crossing the surface location with convex patterns, the deformed MMPs undergo an intrinsic oscillating process to induce damped electrical signals, which can then be converted to a frequency domain for eigenfrequency extraction. Via precisely defining the specific eigenfrequencies of different MMPs, position mapping is realized in crosstalk-free behavior even though all signals are processed by one communication channel and a pair of electrodes. With a customized LabVIEW program, the surface information (<i>e.g</i>., letters, numbers, and Braille) can be accurately reconstructed by the frequency sequence produced in a single scanning procedure. We expect that the proposed interface can be a convenient and powerful platform for intelligent surface information perception and an HMI system in the future.

Title: The quantum house of cards.
Year: 2024
Authors: Waintal Xavier
Abstract: Quantum computers have been proposed to solve a number of important problems such as discovering new drugs, new catalysts for fertilizer production, breaking encryption protocols, optimizing financial portfolios, or implementing new artificial intelligence applications. Yet, to date, a simple task such as multiplying 3 by 5 is beyond existing quantum hardware. This article examines the difficulties that would need to be solved for quantum computers to live up to their promises. I discuss the whole stack of technologies that has been envisioned to build a quantum computer from the top layers (the actual algorithms and associated applications) down to the very bottom ones (the quantum hardware, its control electronics, cryogeny, etc.) while not forgetting the crucial intermediate layer of quantum error correction.

Title: Electrophysiological representations of multivariate human emotion experience.
Year: 2023
Authors: Liu Jin, Hu Xin, Shen Xinke, Song Sen, Zhang Dan
Abstract: <b>ABSTRACT</b>Despite the fact that human daily emotions are co-occurring by nature, most neuroscience studies have primarily adopted a univariate approach to identify the neural representation of emotion (emotion experience within a single emotion category) without adequate consideration of the co-occurrence of different emotions (emotion experience across different emotion categories simultaneously). To investigate the neural representations of multivariate emotion experience, this study employed the inter-situation representational similarity analysis (RSA) method. Researchers used an EEG dataset of 78 participants who watched 28 video clips and rated their experience on eight emotion categories. The EEG-based electrophysiological representation was extracted as the power spectral density (PSD) feature per channel in the five frequency bands. The inter-situation RSA method revealed significant correlations between the multivariate emotion experience ratings and PSD features in the Alpha and Beta bands, primarily over the frontal and parietal-occipital brain regions. The study found the identified EEG representations to be reliable with sufficient situations and participants. Moreover, through a series of ablation analyses, the inter-situation RSA further demonstrated the stability and specificity of the EEG representations for multivariate emotion experience. These findings highlight the importance of adopting a multivariate perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the neural representation of human emotion experience.

Title: Multidimensional Cross-Linking and Real-Time Informatics for Multiprotein Interaction Studies.
Year: 2024
Authors: Mohr Jared P, Caudal Arianne, Tian Rong, Bruce James E
Abstract: Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry is a technique used to study protein structures and identify protein complexes. Traditionally, chemical cross-linkers contain two reactive groups, allowing them to covalently bond a pair of proximal residues, either within a protein or between two proteins. The output of a cross-linking experiment is a list of interacting site pairs that provide structural constraints for modeling of new structures and complexes. Due to the binary reactive nature of cross-linking reagents, only pairs of interacting sites can be directly observed, and assembly of higher-order structures typically requires prior knowledge of complex composition or iterative docking to produce a putative model. Here, we describe a new tetrameric cross-linker bearing four amine-reactive groups, allowing it to covalently link up to four proteins simultaneously and a real-time instrument method to facilitate the identification of these tetrameric cross-links. We applied this new cross-linker to isolated mitochondria and identified a number of higher-order cross-links in various OXPHOS complexes and ATP synthase, demonstrating its utility in characterizing complex interfaces. We also show that higher-order cross-links can be used to effectively filter models of large protein assemblies generated by using Alphafold. Higher-dimensional cross-linking provides a new avenue for characterizing multiple protein interfaces, even in complex samples such as intact mitochondria.

Title: Electrochemically Induced Phase Transformation in Vanadium Oxide Boosts Zn-Ion Intercalation.
Year: 2024
Authors: Mo Li'e, Huang Yang, Wang Yifan, Wei Tingting, Zhang Xianxi, Zhang Hong, Ren Yingke, Ji Denghui, Li Zhaoqian, Hu Linhua
Abstract: Vanadium oxides are excellent cathode materials with large storage capacities for aqueous zinc-ion batteries, but their further development has been hampered by their low electronic conductivity and slow Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. Here, an electrochemically induced phase transformation strategy is proposed to mitigate and overcome these barriers. <i>In situ</i> X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the complete transformation of tunnel-like structural V<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub> into layered V<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O during the initial electrochemical charging process. Theoretical calculations reveal that the phase transformation is crucial to reducing the Zn<sup>2+</sup> migration energy barrier and facilitating fast charge storage kinetics. The calculated band structures indicate that the bandgap of V<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.0006 eV) is lower than that of V<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub> (0.5010 eV), which enhanced the excitation of charge carriers to the conduction band, favoring electron transfer in redox reactions. As a result, the transformed V<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O delivers a high capacity of 609 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, superior rate performance (300 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>), fast-charging capability (<7 min charging for 465 mA h g<sup>-1</sup>), and excellent cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 346 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 5 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 5000 cycles.

Abstract: Obesity is a known cardiovascular risk factor and associated with higher postoperative complication rates in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In heart failure (HF), conflicting evidence in terms of survival has been reported, whereas sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis. An increasing number of HF patients require left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantations. The postoperative mortality has improved in recent years but is still relatively high. The impact of body composition on outcome in this population remains unclear. The aim of this investigation was to examine the preoperative computed tomography (CT) body composition as a predictor of the postoperative outcome in advanced HF patients, who receive LVAD implantations.

Title: Preterm Birth: Screening and Prediction.
Year: 2023
Authors: Creswell Lyndsay, Rolnik Daniel Lorber, Lindow Stephen W, O'Gorman Neil
Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB) affects approximately 10% of births globally each year and is the most significant direct cause of neonatal death and of long-term disability worldwide. Early identification of women at high risk of PTB is important, given the availability of evidence-based, effective screening modalities, which facilitate decision-making on preventative strategies, particularly transvaginal sonographic cervical length (CL) measurement. There is growing evidence that combining CL with quantitative fetal fibronectin (qfFN) and maternal risk factors in the extensively peer-reviewed and validated QUanititative Innovation in Predicting Preterm birth (QUiPP) application can aid both the triage of patients who present as emergencies with symptoms of preterm labor and high-risk asymptomatic women attending PTB surveillance clinics. The QUiPP app risk of delivery thus supports shared decision-making with patients on the need for increased outpatient surveillance, in-patient treatment for preterm labor or simply reassurance for those unlikely to deliver preterm. Effective triage of patients at preterm gestations is an obstetric clinical priority as correctly timed administration of antenatal corticosteroids will maximise their neonatal benefits. This review explores the predictive capacity of existing predictive tests for PTB in both singleton and multiple pregnancies, including the QUiPP app v.2. and discusses promising new research areas, which aim to predict PTB through cervical stiffness and elastography measurements, metabolomics, extracellular vesicles and artificial intelligence.

Title: Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Drinking Water: A Narrative Review.
Year: 2023
Authors: Maroju Revathi G, Choudhari Sonali G, Shaikh Mohammed Kamran, Borkar Sonali K, Mendhe Harshal
Abstract: Waterborne illnesses are a significant concern worldwide. The management of water resources can be facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) with the help of data analytics, regression models, and algorithms. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations depends on understanding, communicating, and measuring the value of water and incorporating it into decision-making. Various barriers are used from the source to the consumer to prevent microbiological contamination of drinking water sources or reduce contamination to levels safe for human health. Infrastructure development and capacity-building policies should be integrated with guidelines on applying AI to problems relating to water to ensure good development outcomes. Communities can live healthily with such technology if they can provide clean, economical, and sustainable water to the ecosystem as a whole. Quick and accurate identification of waterborne pathogens in drinking and recreational water sources is essential for treating and controlling the spread of water-related diseases, especially in resource-constrained situations. To ensure successful development outcomes, policies on infrastructure development and capacity building should be combined with those on applying AI to water-related problems. The primary focus of this study is the use of AI in managing drinking water and preventing waterborne illness.

Title: Brain oscillations in reflecting motor status and recovery induced by action observation-driven robotic hand intervention in chronic stroke.
Year: 2023
Authors: Yue Zan, Xiao Peng, Wang Jing, Tong Raymond Kai-Yu
Abstract: Hand rehabilitation in chronic stroke remains challenging, and finding markers that could reflect motor function would help to understand and evaluate the therapy and recovery. The present study explored whether brain oscillations in different electroencephalogram (EEG) bands could indicate the motor status and recovery induced by action observation-driven brain-computer interface (AO-BCI) robotic therapy in chronic stroke. The neurophysiological data of 16 chronic stroke patients who received 20-session BCI hand training is the basis of the study presented here. Resting-state EEG was recorded during the observation of non-biological movements, while task-stage EEG was recorded during the observation of biological movements in training. The motor performance was evaluated using the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), and significant improvements (<i>p</i> < 0.05) on both scales were found in patients after the intervention. Averaged EEG band power in the affected hemisphere presented negative correlations with scales pre-training; however, no significant correlations (<i>p</i> > 0.01) were found both in the pre-training and post-training stages. After comparing the variation of oscillations over training, we found patients with good and poor recovery presented different trends in delta, low-beta, and high-beta variations, and only patients with good recovery presented significant changes in EEG band power after training (delta band, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Importantly, motor improvements in ARAT correlate significantly with task EEG power changes (low-beta, c.c = 0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.005; high-beta, c.c = 0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and task/rest EEG power ratio changes (delta, c.c = -0.738, <i>p</i> = 0.003; low-beta, c.c = 0.67, <i>p</i> = 0.009; high-beta, c.c = 0.839, <i>p</i> = 0.000). These results suggest that, in chronic stroke, EEG band power may not be a good indicator of motor status. However, ipsilesional oscillation changes in the delta and beta bands provide potential biomarkers related to the therapeutic-induced improvement of motor function in effective BCI intervention, which may be useful in understanding the brain plasticity changes and contribute to evaluating therapy and recovery in chronic-stage motor rehabilitation.

Title: Effect of Danshen for improving clinical outcomes in patients with bladder cancer: a retrospective, population-based study.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chen Yi-Hsin, Chen Chih-Tsung, Wu Han-Ping
Abstract: <b>Introduction:</b> Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a broad application in healthcare, with Danshen being a notable herb used in Eastern medicine for cancer treatment. This study aims to explore the relationship between Danshen use and cardiovascular risks among bladder cancer patients. <b>Methods:</b> Patients were selected based on a confirmed diagnosis of bladder cancer with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to control for certain comorbidities and treatments. Utilizing Taiwan's National Health Insurance data from 2003 to 2013, this retrospective, population-based study identified three groups: 525 patients treated with Danshen, 6,419 patients not treated with TCM, and 4,356 patients treated with TCM but not with Danshen. The Cox proportional hazard model was employed to estimate the risks of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and mortality while accounting for various confounders. <b>Results:</b> The overall incidence of MACEs was significantly lower in the Danshen group (5%) compared to the TCM (8.1%) and non-TCM (9.9%) groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The Cox model revealed that bladder cancer patients treated with Danshen had the lowest risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.84) and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.82). <b>Discussion:</b> The findings suggest that Danshen reduces the risk of MACE and all-cause mortality in bladder cancer patients, highlighting its potential benefits. This underpins the necessity for further research to substantiate the cardiovascular benefits of Danshen in bladder cancer patients and potentially broaden its application in oncology healthcare.

Title: <i>True-T</i> - Improving T-cell response quantification with holistic artificial intelligence based prediction in immunohistochemistry images.
Year: 2024
Authors: Makhlouf Yasmine, Singh Vivek Kumar, Craig Stephanie, McArdle Aoife, French Dominique, Loughrey Maurice B, Oliver Nicola, Acevedo Juvenal Baena, O'Reilly Paul, James Jacqueline A, Maxwell Perry, Salto-Tellez Manuel
Abstract: The immune response associated with oncogenesis and potential oncological ther- apeutic interventions has dominated the field of cancer research over the last decade. T-cell lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment are a crucial aspect of cancer's adaptive immunity, and the quantification of T-cells in specific can- cer types has been suggested as a potential diagnostic aid. However, this is cur- rently not part of routine diagnostics. To address this challenge, we present a new method called <i>True-T</i>, which employs artificial intelligence-based techniques to quantify T-cells in colorectal cancer (CRC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. <i>True-T</i> analyses the chromogenic tissue hybridization signal of three widely recognized T-cell markers (CD3, CD4, and CD8). Our method employs a pipeline consisting of three stages: T-cell segmentation, density estimation from the segmented mask, and prediction of individual five-year survival rates. In the first stage, we utilize the U-Net method, where a pre-trained ResNet-34 is em- ployed as an encoder to extract clinically relevant T-cell features. The segmenta- tion model is trained and evaluated individually, demonstrating its generalization in detecting the CD3, CD4, and CD8 biomarkers in IHC images. In the second stage, the density of T-cells is estimated using the predicted mask, which serves as a crucial indicator for patient survival statistics in the third stage. This ap- proach was developed and tested in 1041 patients from four reference diagnostic institutions, ensuring broad applicability. The clinical effectiveness of <i>True-T</i> is demonstrated in stages II-IV CRC by offering valuable prognostic information that surpasses previous quantitative gold standards, opening possibilities for po- tential clinical applications. Finally, to evaluate the robustness and broader ap- plicability of our approach without additional training, we assessed the universal accuracy of the CD3 component of the <i>True-T</i> algorithm across 13 distinct solid tumors.

Title: HVDROPDB datasets for research in retinopathy of prematurity.
Year: 2024
Authors: Agrawal Ranjana, Walambe Rahee, Kotecha Ketan, Gaikwad Anita, Deshpande Col Madan, Kulkarni Sucheta
Abstract: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a retinal disorder that may bring about blindness in preterm infants. Early detection and treatment of ROP can prevent this blindness. The gold standard technique for ROP screening is indirect ophthalmoscopy performed by ophthalmologists. The scarcity of medical professionals and inter-observer heterogeneity in ROP grading are two of the screening concerns. Researchers employ artificial intelligence (AI) driven ROP screening systems to assist medical experts. A major hurdle in developing these systems is the unavailability of annotated data sets of fundus images. Anatomical landmarks in the retina, such as the optic disc, macula, blood vessels, and ridge, are used to identify ROP characteristics. HVDROPDB is the first dataset to be published for the retinal structure segmentation of fundus images of preterm infants. It is prepared from two diverse imaging systems on the Indian population for segmenting the lesions mentioned above and annotated by a group of ROP experts. Each dataset contains retinal fundus images of premature infants with the ground truths prepared manually to assist researchers in developing explainable automated screening systems.

Title: A dataset of ITS-G5 and cellular vehicular connectivity in urban environment.
Year: 2024
Authors: Dias Duarte, Rosmaninho Rodrigo, Figueiredo Andreia, Almeida Pedro, Luís Miguel, Rito Pedro, Raposo Duarte, Sargento Susana
Abstract: Connecting vehicles to the Internet is an emerging challenge of wireless networks. There are two competing methods for achieving this. First, the wireless local area network (WLAN) approach is based on the IEEE 802.11p standard (in its European version called ETSI ITS-G5) created for Cooperative-Intelligent Transportation System applications. Second, the cellular network approach is based on LTE/5G technologies which have been exploited in recent years to support vehicular applications. Advantages such as high bandwidth, high coverage and high reliability make cellular networks a great option for the vehicular environment. This article describes two datasets that support the analysis of WLAN (ETSI ITS-G5) and Cellular (LTE/5G) technologies in a real vehicular and road environment. The two datasets summarize the results obtained in a collection of network performance tests performed in the city of Aveiro, Portugal. In these tests, a set of vehicles (8 On-Board Units) moved randomly around the city, passing near a group of stationary nodes (11 Road-Side Units) uploading data to a server. In the WLAN dataset, data was sent using the ETSI ITS-G5 technology, whereas, in the Cellular dataset, data was sent using LTE/5G technologies. While testing, location, signal quality, and network performance data (achieved throughput, jitter, etc.) were collected. This dataset can support a realistic analysis of WLAN and Cellular performance in an environment that is not only vehicular but also urban, with obstacles and interference.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention as a means to address the transparency and interpretability challenges posed by black box AI models. In the context of the manufacturing industry, where complex problems and decision-making processes are widespread, the XMANAI platform emerges as a solution to enable transparent and trustworthy collaboration between humans and machines. By leveraging advancements in XAI and catering the prompt collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, the platform enables the construction of interpretable AI models that offer high transparency without compromising performance. This paper introduces the approach to building the XMANAI platform and highlights its potential to resolve the "transparency paradox" of AI. The platform not only addresses technical challenges related to transparency but also caters to the specific needs of the manufacturing industry, including lifecycle management, security, and trusted sharing of AI assets. The paper provides an overview of the XMANAI platform main functionalities, addressing the challenges faced during the development and presenting the evaluation framework to measure the performance of the delivered XAI solutions. It also demonstrates the benefits of the XMANAI approach in achieving transparency in manufacturing decision-making, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and machines, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing business value.

Title: Leveraging Emotion for Behavior Change: Lessons from Implementation of the "Emo-Demo" Behavior Change Technique in Rural Mozambique.
Year: 2023
Authors: Costa Sofia, Guambe Berta, Boaventura Cecilia, Nordhagen Stella
Abstract: Innovative social behavior change communication (SBCC) can help improve child nutrition, but little is known about the process of implementing innovative nutrition SBCC strategies in resource-poor settings and associated challenges. This research study examines emotional demonstrations (Emo-Demos), interactive game-like group activities that aim to spark behavior change by pulling emotional levers. It seeks to determine whether they are feasible and acceptable for implementers and targeted community members in rural Mozambique, aiming to draw lessons for the application of similar highly interactive SBCC approaches in resource-poor settings-a key equity issue. This is done through a series of structured observations of the approach being delivered in seven communities as well as interviews with facilitators and participants. Results show the Emo-Demos were generally feasible to implement as planned and largely acceptable for both facilitators and participants. However, facilitators did not always understand the theory behind them, the importance of them being interactive, and the exact steps that needed to be followed to do them correctly. Participants universally reported enjoying the sessions and understood the lessons taught, and were able to translate them into potential behavior changes. However, few reported the expected emotional reaction to the sessions, and some had difficulty understanding the symbolic use of props in the exercises. The results underline the importance of strong training of SBCC facilitators, including on underlying theory; adapting approaches to local realities; and considering the incentives for participants to attend. These steps can help ensure high-quality SBCC that functions even in resource-poor settings, increasing intervention equity.

Title: METTL14 promotes IL-6-induced viability, glycolysis and inflammation in HaCaT cells via the m6A modification of TRIM27.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chen Yiran, Xiang Yanwei, Miao Xiao, Kuai Le, Ding Xiaojie, Ma Tian, Li Bin, Fan Bin
Abstract: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine generated by healthy constituents of the skin, but is also up-regulated by a wide range of skin lesions and inflammatory conditions to trigger cytopathy of skin cells. TRIM27 was identified to contribute to the functional effects of IL-6 on skin cells. However, the underlying mechanism was not clear. Lentivirus infection was used for gene overexpression or silencing. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to respectively assess mRNA and protein levels. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. Extracellular flux analysis was used to assess the levels of oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate. Mouse back skin was treated with imiquimod to produce psoriasis-like inflammation in vivo. Histological assessment and immunohistochemistry staining were respectively applied to analyse lesioned mouse and human skin samples. IL-6-induced increased viability, glycolysis and inflammation in keratinocytes was inhibited both by a chemical methylation inhibitor and by METTL14 knockdown. Further investigation found that METTL14 induces m6A methylation of TRIM27, which is recognized by a m6A reader, IGF2BP2. Elevation of TRIM27 level and activation of IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway were found in an in vivo psoriasis-like inflammation model, whereas inhibition m6A methylation strongly alleviated the inflammation. Finally, METTL14, TRIM27, STAT3, p-STAT3 and IL-6 expressions were all found to be increased in clinical skin samples of psoriatic patients. Our results unravelled METTL14/TRIM27/IGF2BP2 signalling axis in keratinocyte cytopathy, which plays a critical role in facilitating the activation of IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway. Our findings should provide inspirations for the design of new therapeutics for skin inflammatory diseases including psoriasis.

Abstract: Chronic wounds contribute to significant healthcare and economic burden worldwide. Wound assessment remains challenging given its complex and dynamic nature. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods in wound analysis is promising. Explainable modelling can help its integration and acceptance in healthcare systems. We aim to develop an explainable AI model for analysing vascular wound images among an Asian population. Two thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven wound images from a vascular wound image registry from a tertiary institution in Singapore were utilized. The dataset was split into training, validation and test sets. Wound images were classified into four types (neuroischaemic ulcer [NIU], surgical site infections [SSI], venous leg ulcers [VLU], pressure ulcer [PU]), measured with automatic estimation of width, length and depth and segmented into 18 wound and peri-wound features. Data pre-processing was performed using oversampling and augmentation techniques. Convolutional and deep learning models were utilized for model development. The model was evaluated with accuracy, F1 score and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Explainability methods were used to interpret AI decision reasoning. A web browser application was developed to demonstrate results of the wound AI model with explainability. After development, the model was tested on additional 15 476 unlabelled images to evaluate effectiveness. After the development on the training and validation dataset, the model performance on unseen labelled images in the test set achieved an AUROC of 0.99 for wound classification with mean accuracy of 95.9%. For wound measurements, the model achieved AUROC of 0.97 with mean accuracy of 85.0% for depth classification, and AUROC of 0.92 with mean accuracy of 87.1% for width and length determination. For wound segmentation, an AUROC of 0.95 and mean accuracy of 87.8% was achieved. Testing on unlabelled images, the model confidence score for wound classification was 82.8% with an explainability score of 60.6%. Confidence score was 87.6% for depth classification with 68.0% explainability score, while width and length measurement obtained 93.0% accuracy score with 76.6% explainability. Confidence score for wound segmentation was 83.9%, while explainability was 72.1%. Using explainable AI models, we have developed an algorithm and application for analysis of vascular wound images from an Asian population with accuracy and explainability. With further development, it can be utilized as a clinical decision support system and integrated into existing healthcare electronic systems.

Title: Understanding progression from pre-school wheezing to school-age asthma: Can modern data approaches help?
Year: 2023
Authors: Custovic Darije, Fontanella Sara, Custovic Adnan
Abstract: Preschool wheezing and childhood asthma create a heavy disease burden which is only exacerbated by the complexity of the conditions. Preschool wheezing exhibits both "curricular" and "aetiological" heterogeneity: that is, heterogeneity across patients both in the time-course of its development and in its underpinning pathological mechanisms. Since these are not fully understood, but clinical presentations across patients may nonetheless be similar, current diagnostic labels are imprecise-not mapping cleanly onto underlying disease mechanisms-and prognoses uncertain. These uncertainties also make a identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention difficult. In the past few decades, carefully designed birth cohort studies have collected "big data" on a large scale, incorporating not only a wealth of longitudinal clinical data, but also detailed information from modalities as varied as imaging, multiomics, and blood biomarkers. The profusion of big data has seen the proliferation of what we term "modern data approaches" (MDAs)-grouping together machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science-to make sense and make use of this data. In this review, we survey applications of MDAs (with an emphasis on machine learning) in childhood wheeze and asthma, highlighting the extent of their successes in providing tools for prognosis, unpicking the curricular heterogeneity of these conditions, clarifying the limitations of current diagnostic criteria, and indicating directions of research for uncovering the etiology of the diseases underlying these conditions. Specifically, we focus on the trajectories of childhood wheeze phenotypes. Further, we provide an explainer of the nature and potential use of MDAs and emphasize the scope of what we can hope to achieve with them.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline materials with intrinsic porosity that offer a wide range of potential applications spanning diverse fields. Yet, the main goal in the COF research area is to achieve the most stable thermodynamic product while simultaneously targeting the desired size and structure crucial for enabling specific functions. While significant progress is made in the synthesis and processing of 2D COFs, the development of processable 3D COF nanocrystals remains challenging. Here, a water-based nanoreactor technology for producing processable sub-40 nm 3D COF nanoparticles at ambient conditions is presented. Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which are limited by larger crystallites.

Title: AMGDTI: drug-target interaction prediction based on adaptive meta-graph learning in heterogeneous network.
Year: 2023
Authors: Su Yansen, Hu Zhiyang, Wang Fei, Bin Yannan, Zheng Chunhou, Li Haitao, Chen Haowen, Zeng Xiangxiang
Abstract: Prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is essential in medicine field, since it benefits the identification of molecular structures potentially interacting with drugs and facilitates the discovery and reposition of drugs. Recently, much attention has been attracted to network representation learning to learn rich information from heterogeneous data. Although network representation learning algorithms have achieved success in predicting DTI, several manually designed meta-graphs limit the capability of extracting complex semantic information. To address the problem, we introduce an adaptive meta-graph-based method, termed AMGDTI, for DTI prediction. In the proposed AMGDTI, the semantic information is automatically aggregated from a heterogeneous network by training an adaptive meta-graph, thereby achieving efficient information integration without requiring domain knowledge. The effectiveness of the proposed AMGDTI is verified on two benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the AMGDTI method overall outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in predicting DTI and achieves the accurate identification of novel DTIs. It is also verified that the adaptive meta-graph exhibits flexibility and effectively captures complex fine-grained semantic information, enabling the learning of intricate heterogeneous network topology and the inference of potential drug-target relationship.

Title: THItoGene: a deep learning method for predicting spatial transcriptomics from histological images.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jia Yuran, Liu Junliang, Chen Li, Zhao Tianyi, Wang Yadong
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics unveils the complex dynamics of cell regulation and transcriptomes, but it is typically cost-prohibitive. Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images via artificial intelligence offers a more affordable option, yet existing methods fall short in extracting deep-level information from pathological images. In this paper, we present THItoGene, a hybrid neural network that utilizes dynamic convolutional and capsule networks to adaptively sense potential molecular signals in histological images for exploring the relationship between high-resolution pathology image phenotypes and regulation of gene expression. A comprehensive benchmark evaluation using datasets from human breast cancer and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has demonstrated the superior performance of THItoGene in spatial gene expression prediction. Moreover, THItoGene has demonstrated its capacity to decipher both the spatial context and enrichment signals within specific tissue regions.

Title: Satellite-Based On-Orbit Printing of 3D Tumor Models.
Year: 2023
Authors: Mo Xingwu, Zhang Yanmei, Wang Zixuan, Zhou Xianhao, Zhang Zhenrui, Fang Yongcong, Fan Zilian, Guo Yihan, Zhang Ting, Xiong Zhuo
Abstract: Space three dimension (3D） bioprinting provides a precise and bionic tumor model for evaluating the compound effect of the space environment on tumors, thereby providing insight into the progress of the disease and potential treatments. However, space 3D bioprinting faces several challenges, including prelaunch uncertainty, possible liquid leakage, long-term culture in space, automatic equipment control, data acquisition, and transmission. Here, a novel satellite-based 3D bioprinting device with high structural strength, small volume, and low weight (<6 kg) is developed. A microgel-based biphasic thermosensitive bioink and suspension medium that supports the on-orbit printing and in situ culture of complex tumor models is developed. An intelligent control algorithm that enables the automatic control of 3D printing, autofocusing, fluorescence imaging, and data transfer back to the ground is developed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that on-orbit printing of tumor models is achieved in space with stable morphology and moderate viability via a satellite. It is found that 3D tumor models are more sensitive to antitumor drugs in space than on Earth. This study opens up a new avenue for 3D bioprinting in space and offers new possibilities for future research in space life science and medicine.

Title: The intelligent prediction of membrane fouling during membrane filtration by mathematical models and artificial intelligence models.
Year: 2024
Authors: Wang Lu, Li Zonghao, Fan Jianhua, Han Zhiwu
Abstract: Recently, membrane separation technology has been widely utilized in filtration process intensification due to its efficient performance and unique advantages, but membrane fouling limits its development and application. Therefore, the research on membrane fouling prediction and control technology is crucial to effectively reduce membrane fouling and improve separation performance. This review first introduces the main factors (operating condition, material characteristics, and membrane structure properties) and the corresponding principles that affect membrane fouling. In addition, mathematical models (Hermia model and Tandem resistance model), artificial intelligence (AI) models (Artificial neural networks model and fuzzy control model), and AI optimization methods (genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm), which are widely used for the prediction of membrane fouling, are summarized and analyzed for comparison. The AI models are usually significantly better than the mathematical models in terms of prediction accuracy and applicability of membrane fouling and can monitor membrane fouling in real-time by working in concert with image processing technology, which is crucial for membrane fouling prediction and mechanism studies. Meanwhile, AI models for membrane fouling prediction in the separation process have shown good potential and are expected to be further applied in large-scale industrial applications for separation and filtration process intensification. This review will help researchers understand the challenges and future research directions in membrane fouling prediction, which is expected to provide an effective method to reduce or even solve the bottleneck problem of membrane fouling, and to promote the further application of AI modeling in environmental and food fields.

Title: Darwinian evolution has become dogma; AI can rescue what is salvageable.
Year: 2023
Authors: Brown Olen R, Hullender David A
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), as an academic discipline, is traceable to the mid-1950s but it is currently exploding in applications with successes and concerns. AI can be defined as intelligence demonstrated by computers, with intelligence difficult to define but it must include concepts of ability to learn, reason, and generalize from a vast amount of information and, we propose, to infer meaning. The type of AI known as general AI, has strong, but unrealized potential both for assessing and also for solving major problems with the scientific theory of Darwinian evolution, including its modern variants and for origin of life studies. Specifically, AI should be applied first to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the assumptions and empirical information underpinning theories of the origin of life and probability of its evolution. AI should then be applied to assess the scientific validity of the theory of how abundant life came to be on earth.

Title: A kinetic-assisted growth curve prediction method for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii incorporating transfer learning.
Year: 2023
Authors: Jiang Mingqi, Cao Xupeng, Wang Zhuo, Xing Mengmeng, Sun Zhijian, Wang Jian, Hu Jingtao
Abstract: Traditional predictions of microalgal growth states rely on empirical or easily implementable kinetic models, leading to significant biases and elevated cost. This study proposes a kinetic-assisted machine learning method for predicting the growth curve of microalgal biomass under small sample conditions. Firstly, a microalgae growth kinetic model is constructed based on the logistic model. A two-stage kinetic fitting strategy is specified to account for the light-dark ratio. The Box-Behnken method is employed for experimental design. Then, using Two-stage TrAdaboost.R2 algorithm, the kinetic model is utilized as the source domain, and the experimental design data serves as the target domain for training machine learning models. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms a single machine learning model in terms of prediction and has the potential to rapidly estimate microalgal growth trends under different conditions and accurately predict harvested biomass, potentially reducing the need for laborious, expensive, and time-consuming laboratory trials.

Title: Deep learning-based efficient drone-borne sensing of cyanobacterial blooms using a clique-based feature extraction approach.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shin Jihoon, Lee Gunhyeong, Kim TaeHo, Cho Kyung Hwa, Hong Seok Min, Kwon Do Hyuck, Pyo JongCheol, Cha YoonKyung
Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing techniques provide a new horizon for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of harmful algal blooms (HABs) using hyperspectral data in inland water. In this study, a hierarchical concatenated variational autoencoder (HCVAE) is proposed as an efficient and accurate deep learning (DL) based bio-optical model. To demonstrate its usefulness in retrieving algal pigments, the HCVAE is applied to bloom-prone regions in Daecheong Lake, South Korea. By abstracting the similarity between highly related features using layer-wise clique-based latent-feature extraction, HCVAE reduces the computational loads in deriving outputs while preventing performance degradation. Graph-based clique-detection uses information theory-based criteria to group the related reflectance spectra. Consequently, six latent features were extracted from 79 spectral bands to consist of a multilevel hierarchy of HCVAE that can simultaneously estimate concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC). Despite the parsimonious model architecture, the Chl-a and PC concentrations estimated by HCVAE closely agree with the measured concentrations, with test R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.76 and 0.82, respectively. In addition, spatial distribution maps of algal pigments obtained from HCVAE using drone-borne reflectance successfully capture the blooming spots. Based on its multilevel hierarchical architecture, HCVAE can provide the importance of latent features along with their individual wavelengths using Shapley additive explanations. The most important latent features covered the spectral regions associated with both Chl-a and PC. The lightweight neural network DNN<sub>sel</sub>, which uses only the spectral bands of highest importance in latent-feature extraction, performed comparably to HCVAE. The study results demonstrate the utility of the multilevel hierarchical architecture as a comprehensive assessment model for near-real-time drone-borne sensing of HABs. Moreover, HCVAE is applicable to a wide range of environmental big data, as it can handle numerous sets of features.

Title: Effect of moisture content on larval gut microbiome and the conversion of pig manure by black soldier fly.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Lili, Wang Shengwen, Yang Rencan, Zhang Bin, Xu Le, Hu Qingquan, Zhao Zhiyong, Cao Zhenhui
Abstract: The study investigated the influence of varied moisture levels in pig manure on the gut microbiome of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) and their waste conversion efficiency. This encompassed alterations in nutrient components of both BSFL and pig manure, diversity and characterization of the BSFL gut microbiota, and the reciprocal effects between the BSFL gut microbiota and their growth performance and nutrient composition. Additionally, the investigation delved into the changes in the bacterial community and the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria in pig manure. An initial mixture of fresh pig manure and wheat bran was prepared with a 60 % moisture content (Group A). Distilled water was subsequently added to adjust the moisture levels, resulting in mixtures with 65 % (Group B), 70 % (Group C), and 75 % (Group D) moisture content. Each group underwent BSFL digestion over ten days. Groups C (3.87 ± 0.05 mg/worm) and D (3.97 ± 0.08 mg/worm) showed significantly higher bioconversion efficiencies and enhanced BSFL growth compared to Groups A (2.66 ± 0.21 mg/worm) and B (3.09 ± 0.09 mg/worm) (P < 0.05). A 75 % moisture level was identified as ideal, positively influencing fecal conversion efficiency (FCE) (9.57 ± 0.14 %), crude fat intake (8.92 ± 0.56 %), protein (46.60 ± 0.54 %), and total phosphorus (1.37 ± 0.08 %) from pig manure, and subsequent nutrient accumulation in BSFLs. A decline in larval crude ash content indicated higher organic matter and an increased pig manure conversion rate with elevated moisture. High-throughput sequencing and diversity analyses confirmed different moisture contents influenced the BSFL gut microbiota. Bacteroidetes (32.7-62.0 %), Proteobacteria (6.8-29.3 %), Firmicutes (5.8-23.4 %), and Actinobacteria (1.9-29.0 %) were predominant phyla. A 75 % moisture content significantly impacted the BSFL biomass conversion and growth performance. Additionally, Larval feces met non-hazardous fertilizer standards, according to NY-525 (2012).

Title: Development of intelligent Municipal Solid waste Sorter for recyclables.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lin Yu-Hao, Mao Wei-Lung, Fathurrahman Haris Imam Karim
Abstract: Sorting Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) has helped promote the awareness of sustainable development of environment. A robot equipped with an intelligent deep learning (DL) detection algorithm have been proposed to improve the sorting task. But most of the related studies aimed to better the DL algorithms on MSW detection, and few studies integrated the DL algorithms with a robot to identify the dominated factors to Intelligent MSW Sorter (IMSWS). Therefore, this study is to develop IMSWS prototype to better sort MSW, based on the pick-and-place process, and preliminarily evaluate the dominated factors. First, the delta robot prototype was manufactured, and IMSWS was performed with a camera to acquire the RGB image and the height of a MSW in the conveyor belt. The DL algorithm, YOLOv3 or YOLOv4, detected the type and plane location of the MSWs in the conveyor belt. Next, the sequence program transferred the valid MSW data to the delta robot. After the calculation of the absorbed location of the target MSW was made, the arm of this delta robot moved to absorb and then transfer the MSW to the bin. Results showed that the IMSWS prototype could sort the multi-object MSWs in the MSW stream. Both YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 reached high detection accuracy on the MSW image dataset. However, the improvement should be made in the actually moving MSW stream even though the YOLOv4 performed the acceptable detection accuracy. The gripping stability of the arm mainly dominated the performance of IMSWS, and this should be improved first.

Title: Solvatochromic and Proton-Responsive characteristics of Bi-1,3,4-Oxadiazole derivatives with symmetric dimethylamino substitution.
Year: 2024
Authors: Zheng Weitao, Wang Yuhan, Chen Fangyi, Bai Binglian, Wang Haitao, Li Min
Abstract: D-A molecules find extensive use in intelligent stimulus-response systems due to their exceptional attributes, including high sensitivity, rapid response, wide compatibility, and structural adaptability. The strength of Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of these devices. To enhance the ICT strength and explore new applications for D-A molecules, we meticulously designed a pair of symmetric dimethylamino-substituted bi-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (DMAOXD and DMAOXDBEN). These symmetric D-A-A-D molecules, with strong electron donor terminals, displayed a modest redshift of less than 25 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectra. However, there was a significant redshift in the emission spectra (140 nm for DMAOXD and 170 nm for DMAOXDBEN) when transitioning from cyclohexane to dimethyl sulfoxide, indicating a pronounced ICT characteristic. Theoretical calculations support the idea that the dimethylaminophenyl unit serves as an electron donor in both DMAOXD and DMAOXDBEN, while the 1,3,4-oxadiazole and central benzene ring act as acceptors. The pronounced ICT characteristic observed in DMAOXD and DMAOXDBEN can be attributed to long-distance electron transfer. Additionally, it's noteworthy that the emission of DMAOXD and DMAOXDBEN solution samples can be quenched by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and restored by the addition of triethylamine (TEA). Inspired by this, a pattern created with ink samples containing DMAOXD and DMAOXDBEN can be concealed through fumigation with TFA and subsequently revealed by treating them with TEA, suggesting their potential use in data encryption.

Abstract: Shingles is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and manifests as painful skin rashes. While the recombinant protein-based vaccine proves highly effective, it encounters supply chain challenges due to a shortage of the necessary adjuvant. Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines can be rapidly produced on a large scale, but their effectiveness relies on efficient delivery and sequence design. Here, an mRNA-based VZV vaccine using a synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn-LNP) containing two different ionizable lipids is developed. Syn-LNP shows superior mRNA expression compared to LNPs formulated with either type of ionizable lipid and to a commercialized LNP. After encapsulating VZV glycoprotein E (gE)-encoding mRNA, mgE@Syn-LNP induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice. The magnitude of these responses is similar to that induced by adjuvanted recombinant gE proteins and significantly higher than that observed with live-attenuated VZV. mgE@Syn-LNP exhibits durable humoral responses for over 7 months without obvious adverse effects. In addition, mgE@Syn-LNP protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges. Preliminary studies on the mRNA antigen design reveal that the removal of glycosylation sites of gE greatly reduces its immune responses. Collectively, Syn-LNP encapsulating gE-encoded mRNA holds great promise as a shingles vaccine.

Title: EaLDL: Element-Aware Lifelong Dictionary Learning for Multimode Process Monitoring.
Year: 2023
Authors: Huang Keke, Zhu Hengxing, Wu Dehao, Yang Chunhua, Gui Weihua
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern industry and the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence, data-driven process monitoring methods have gained significant popularity in industrial systems. Traditional static monitoring models struggle to represent the new modes that arise in industrial production processes due to changes in production environments and operating conditions. Retraining these models to address the changes often leads to high computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a multimode process monitoring method based on element-aware lifelong dictionary learning (EaLDL). This method initially treats dictionary elements as fundamental units and measures the global importance of dictionary elements from the perspective of the multimode global learning process. Subsequently, to ensure that the dictionary can represent new modes without losing the representation capability of historical modes during the updating process, we construct a novel surrogate loss to impose constraints on the update of dictionary elements. This constraint enables the continuous updating of the dictionary learning (DL) method to accommodate new modes without compromising the representation of previous modes. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform comprehensive experiments on numerical simulations as well as an industrial process. A comparison is made with several advanced process monitoring methods to assess its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a favorable balance between learning new modes and retaining the memory of historical modes. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits insensitivity to initial points, delivering satisfactory results under various initial conditions.

Title: Unveiling the Quantitative Relationships between Electron Distribution and Steric Hindrance of Organic Amines and Their Reaction Rates with Carbonyl Sulfur: A Theoretical Calculation Investigation.
Year: 2024
Authors: Liu Chuanlei, Chen Yuxiang, Guo Guanchu, Zhao Qiyue, Jiang Hao, Wang Hao, Gao Weikang, Yang Fengjing, Shen Ben-Xian, Sun Hui
Abstract: The removal of carbonyl sulfide (COS) commonly contained in natural gas is of great significance but still very challenging via a widely employed absorption process due to its low reactivity and solubility in various commercial solvents. Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in the exploration of desulfurization solvents. However, practically feasible AI models still lack a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanisms. Machine learning (ML) models established on chemical mechanisms exhibit enhanced chemical interpretability and prediction performance. In this study, we constructed a series of solvent molecules with varying functional groups, including linear aliphatic amines, cyclic aliphatic amines, and aromatic amines and proposed a three-step reaction pathway to dissect the effects of charge and steric hindrance of different substituents on their reaction rates with COS. Chemical descriptors, based on electrostatic potential (ESP), average local ionization energy (ALIE) theory, Hirshfeld charges, and Fukui functions, were used to correlate and predict the electrophilic reactivity of amine groups with COS. Substituents influence the reaction rate by changing the attraction interaction of amine groups to COS molecules and the electron rearrangement in the electrophilic reaction. Furthermore, they have more pronounced steric effects on the reaction rate in the linear amines. The descriptors <i>N_ALIE</i> and <i>q(N)</i> were found to be crucial in predicting the reactivity of amine groups with COS. Present study provides a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanisms of COS with amine compounds, offers specific chemical principles for the development of chemistry-driven ML models, sheds light on other types of electrophilic reactions occurring on amine and phosphine groups, and guides the development of chemical solvents in gas absorption processes.

Title: Can Pretrained Models Really Learn Better Molecular Representations for AI-Aided Drug Discovery?
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhang Ziqiao, Bian Yatao, Xie Ailin, Han Pengju, Zhou Shuigeng
Abstract: Self-supervised pretrained models are gaining increasingly more popularity in AI-aided drug discovery, leading to more and more pretrained models with the promise that they can extract better feature representations for molecules. Yet, the quality of learned representations has not been fully explored. In this work, inspired by the two phenomena of Activity Cliffs (ACs) and Scaffold Hopping (SH) in traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship analysis, we propose a method named <b>Re</b>presentation-<b>P</b>roperty <b>R</b>elationship <b>A</b>nalysis (RePRA) to evaluate the quality of the representations extracted by the pretrained model and visualize the relationship between the representations and properties. The concepts of ACs and SH are generalized from the structure-activity context to the representation-property context, and the underlying principles of RePRA are analyzed theoretically. Two scores are designed to measure the generalized ACs and SH detected by RePRA, and therefore, the quality of representations can be evaluated. In experiments, representations of molecules from 10 target tasks generated by 7 pretrained models are analyzed. The results indicate that the state-of-the-art pretrained models can overcome some shortcomings of canonical Extended-Connectivity FingerPrints, while the correlation between the basis of the representation space and specific molecular substructures are not explicit. Thus, some representations could be even worse than the canonical fingerprints. Our method enables researchers to evaluate the quality of molecular representations generated by their proposed self-supervised pretrained models. And our findings can guide the community to develop better pretraining techniques to regularize the occurrence of ACs and SH.

Title: Educating the next generation of radiologists: a comparative report of ChatGPT and e-learning resources.
Year: 2023
Authors: Meşe İsmail, Altıntaş Taşlıçay Ceylan, Kuzan Beyza Nur, Kuzan Taha Yusuf, Sivrioğlu Ali Kemal
Abstract: Rapid technological advances have transformed medical education, particularly in radiology, which depends on advanced imaging and visual data. Traditional electronic learning (e-learning) platforms have long served as a cornerstone in radiology education, offering rich visual content, interactive sessions, and peer-reviewed materials. They excel in teaching intricate concepts and techniques that necessitate visual aids, such as image interpretation and procedural demonstrations. However, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language model, has made its mark in radiology education. It can generate learning assessments, create lesson plans, act as a round-the-clock virtual tutor, enhance critical thinking, translate materials for broader accessibility, summarize vast amounts of information, and provide real-time feedback for any subject, including radiology. Concerns have arisen regarding ChatGPT's data accuracy, currency, and potential biases, especially in specialized fields such as radiology. However, the quality, accessibility, and currency of e-learning content can also be imperfect. To enhance the educational journey for radiology residents, the integration of ChatGPT with expert-curated e-learning resources is imperative for ensuring accuracy and reliability and addressing ethical concerns. While AI is unlikely to entirely supplant traditional radiology study methods, the synergistic combination of AI with traditional e-learning can create a holistic educational experience.

Title: An Infrared Near-Sensor Reservoir Computing System Based on Large-Dynamic-Space Memristor with Tens of Thousands of States for Dynamic Gesture Perception.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Jiejun, Pan Xinqiang, Zhao Zebin, Xie Yiduo, Luo Wenbo, Xie Qin, Zeng Huizhong, Shuai Yao, Song Zeqian, Wu Chuangui, Zhang Wanli
Abstract: To efficiently process the massive amount of sensor data, it is demanding to develop a new paradigm. Inspired by neurobiological systems, an infrared near-senor reservoir computing (RC) system, consisting of infrared sensors and memristors based on single-crystalline LiTaO<sub>3</sub> and LiNbO<sub>3</sub> (LN) thin film respectively, is demonstrated. The analog memristor is used as a reservoir in the RC system to process sensor signals with spatiotemporal characteristics. LN crystal structure stacked with oxygen octahedra provides favorable conditions for reliable Mott variable-range hopping conduction, which provides the memristor with tens of thousands of reservoir states within a large dynamic range. With the characteristics, the analog sensor signals with high data fidelity can be directly fed to the memristive reservoir, and the spatiotemporal features can be separated and mapped. The system demonstrated a dynamic gesture perception task, achieving an accuracy of 99.6%, which highlights the great application potential of the memristor in signal sensor processing and will advance the application of artificial intelligence in sensor systems. Crystal ion slicing techniques are used to fabricate a single-crystalline thin film for both the memristor and sensor, which opens up the possibility of realizing monolithic integration of a memristor-based near-sensor computing system.

Abstract: High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity is a crucial risk factor for metabolic syndrome, mainly due to adipose tissue dysfunctions associated with it. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study has used genetic screening to identify an obesity-associated human lncRNA LINK-A as a critical molecule bridging the metabolic microenvironment and energy expenditure in vivo by establishing the HFD-induced obesity knock-in (KI) mouse model. Mechanistically, HFD LINK-A KI mice induce the infiltration of inflammatory factors, including IL-1β and CXCL16, through the LINK-A/HB-EGF/HIF1α feedback loop axis in a self-amplified manner, thereby promoting the adipose tissue microenvironment remodeling and adaptive thermogenesis disorder, ultimately leading to obesity and insulin resistance. Notably, LINK-A expression is positively correlated with inflammatory factor expression in individuals who are overweight. Of note, targeting LINK-A via nucleic acid drug antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) attenuate HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome, pointing out LINK-A as a valuable and effective therapeutic target for treating HFD-induced obesity. Briefly, the results reveale the roles of lncRNAs (such as LINK-A) in remodeling tissue inflammatory microenvironments to promote HFD-induced obesity.

Title: Constructing Asymmetric Charge Polarized NiCo Prussian Blue Analogue for Promoted Electrocatalytic Methanol to Formate Conversion.
Year: 2023
Authors: Lin Yunxiang, Wang Yan-Ge, Li Xiaoyu, Zhao Jiahui, Liu Hengjie, Wu Chuanqiang, Yang Li, Li Guang, Qi Zeming, Shan Lei, Jiang Yong, Song Li
Abstract: The highly selective electrochemical conversion of methanol to formate is of great significance for various clean energy devices, but understanding the structure-to-property relationship remains unclear. Here, the asymmetric charge polarized NiCo prussian blue analogue (NiCo PBA-100) is reported to exhibit remarkable catalytic performance with high current density (210 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> @1.65 V vs RHE) and Faraday efficiency (over 90%). Meanwhile, the hybrid water splitting and Zinc-methanol-battery assembled by NiCo PBA-100 display the promoted performance with decent stability. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando Raman spectroscopy indicate that the asymmetric charge polarization in NiCo PBA leads to more unoccupied states of Ni and occupied states of Co, thereby facilitating the rapid transformation of the high-active catalytic centers. Density functional theory calculations combining operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that the final reconstructed catalyst derived by NiCo PBA-100 exhibits rearranged d band properties along with a lowered energy barrier of the rate-determining step and favors the desired formate production.

Title: BioinspiredLLM: Conversational Large Language Model for the Mechanics of Biological and Bio-Inspired Materials.
Year: 2023
Authors: Luu Rachel K, Buehler Markus J
Abstract: The study of biological materials and bio-inspired materials science is well established; however, surprisingly little knowledge is systematically translated to engineering solutions. To accelerate discovery and guide insights, an open-source autoregressive transformer large language model (LLM), BioinspiredLLM, is reported. The model is finetuned with a corpus of over a thousand peer-reviewed articles in the field of structural biological and bio-inspired materials and can be prompted to recall information, assist with research tasks, and function as an engine for creativity. The model has proven that it is able to accurately recall information about biological materials and is further strengthened with enhanced reasoning ability, as well as with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate new data during generation that can also help to traceback sources, update the knowledge base, and connect knowledge domains. BioinspiredLLM also has shown to develop sound hypotheses regarding biological materials design and remarkably so for materials that have never been explicitly studied before. Lastly, the model shows impressive promise in collaborating with other generative artificial intelligence models in a workflow that can reshape the traditional materials design process. This collaborative generative artificial intelligence method can stimulate and enhance bio-inspired materials design workflows. Biological materials are at a critical intersection of multiple scientific fields and models like BioinspiredLLM help to connect knowledge domains.

Title: Enhanced sleep staging with artificial intelligence: a validation study of new software for sleep scoring.
Year: 2023
Authors: Grassi Massimiliano, Daccò Silvia, Caldirola Daniela, Perna Giampaolo, Schruers Koen, Defillo Archie
Abstract: Manual sleep staging (MSS) using polysomnography is a time-consuming task, requires significant training, and can lead to significant variability among scorers. STAGER is a software program based on machine learning algorithms that has been developed by Medibio Limited (Savage, MN, USA) to perform automatic sleep staging using only EEG signals from polysomnography. This study aimed to extensively investigate its agreement with MSS performed during clinical practice and by three additional expert sleep technicians. Forty consecutive polysomnographic recordings of patients referred to three US sleep clinics for sleep evaluation were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Three experienced technicians independently staged the recording using the electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrooculography signals according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. The staging initially performed during clinical practice was also considered. Several agreement statistics between the automatic sleep staging (ASS) and MSS, among the different MSSs, and their differences were calculated. Bootstrap resampling was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals and the statistical significance of the differences. STAGER's ASS was most comparable with, or statistically significantly better than the MSS, except for a partial reduction in the positive percent agreement in the wake stage. These promising results indicate that STAGER software can perform ASS of inpatient polysomnographic recordings accurately in comparison with MSS.

Title: Safer not to know? Shaping liability law and policy to incentivize adoption of predictive AI technologies in the food system.
Year: 2023
Authors: Alexander Carrie S, Smith Aaron, Ivanek Renata
Abstract: Governments, researchers, and developers emphasize creating "trustworthy AI," defined as AI that prevents bias, ensures data privacy, and generates reliable results that perform as expected. However, in some cases problems arise not when AI is <i>not</i> trustworthy, technologically, but when it <i>is</i>. This article focuses on such problems in the food system. AI technologies facilitate the generation of masses of data that may illuminate existing food-safety and employee-safety risks. These systems may collect incidental data that could be used, or may be designed specifically, to assess and manage risks. The predictions and knowledge generated by these data and technologies may increase company liability and expense, and discourage adoption of these predictive technologies. Such problems may extend beyond the food system to other industries. Based on interviews and literature, this article discusses vulnerabilities to liability and obstacles to technology adoption that arise, arguing that "trustworthy AI" cannot be achieved through technology alone, but requires social, cultural, political, as well as technical cooperation. Implications for law and further research are also discussed.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is already considered one of the biggest global health crises. In Rio Grande do Norte, a Brazilian state, the RegulaRN platform was the health information system used to regulate beds for patients with COVID-19. This article explored machine learning and deep learning techniques with RegulaRN data in order to identify the best models and parameters to predict the outcome of a hospitalized patient. A total of 25,366 bed regulations for COVID-19 patients were analyzed. The data analyzed comes from the RegulaRN Platform database from April 2020 to August 2022. From these data, the nine most pertinent characteristics were selected from the twenty available, and blank or inconclusive data were excluded. This was followed by the following steps: data pre-processing, database balancing, training, and test. The results showed better performance in terms of accuracy (84.01%), precision (79.57%), and F1-score (81.00%) for the Multilayer Perceptron model with Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer. The best results for recall (84.67%), specificity (84.67%), and ROC-AUC (91.6%) were achieved by Root Mean Squared Propagation. This study compared different computational methods of machine and deep learning whose objective was to classify bed regulation data for patients with COVID-19 from the RegulaRN Platform. The results have made it possible to identify the best model to help health professionals during the process of regulating beds for patients with COVID-19. The scientific findings of this article demonstrate that the computational methods used applied through a digital health solution, can assist in the decision-making of medical regulators and government institutions in situations of public health crisis.

Title: One step beyond the lab and clinic: "walking the dementia conversation".
Year: 2023
Authors: Zegarra-Valdivia Jonathan Adrián, Aguzzoli-Peres Fernando, Kornhuber Alex, Arshad Faheem, Paredes-Manrique Carmen Noelia
Abstract: Millions of dollars have been lost in dementia research over the last 30 years owing to unsuccessful clinical trials aimed at finding an effective treatment for the condition. Although two promising drugs have been identified, the research effort is insufficient. The dehumanization of patients and the pressure to publish have led to a decline in the quality and usefulness of scientific research. One way to tackle these problems is establishing close contact with those who put their faith in researchers. Fine-tuning the participation of patients with dementia and caregivers in research design and improving their connection and communication with researchers could positively contribute to enhancing the perspectives and designing strategies for scientists in order to generate a new and enriching vision. The Walking the Talk for Dementia event showed that people can still live with dementia despite their condition. Approximately 300 people participated in the all-week "Santiago's Camino" symposium. People living with dementia, caregivers, healthcare professionals, activists, clinicians, and researchers participated in this event. The "Walking the Talk for Dementia" (WTD) event vividly demonstrated a strong commitment to upholding Global Brain Health Institute's (GBHI) core values of Authenticity, Fairness, Openness, Respect, Courage, and Empathy (A FORCE) to advance equity in brain health. These values provide clear guidance for their advocacy initiatives aimed at mitigating the global impact of dementia. Research and development are essential across scientific fields, especially in clinical contexts where involving patients and caregivers is critical. The WTD initiative exemplifies this aspect by bringing together researchers, caregivers, and dementia patients on the Camino de Santiago in Spain.

Title: Artificial intelligence in skeletal metastasis imaging.
Year: 2024
Authors: Dong Xiying, Chen Guilin, Zhu Yuanpeng, Ma Boyuan, Ban Xiaojuan, Wu Nan, Ming Yue
Abstract: In the field of metastatic skeletal oncology imaging, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prominent. Bone metastasis typically indicates the terminal stage of various malignant neoplasms. Once identified, it necessitates a comprehensive revision of the initial treatment regime, and palliative care is often the only resort. Given the gravity of the condition, the diagnosis of bone metastasis should be approached with utmost caution. AI techniques are being evaluated for their efficacy in a range of tasks within medical imaging, including object detection, disease classification, region segmentation, and prognosis prediction in medical imaging. These methods offer a standardized solution to the frequently subjective challenge of image interpretation.This subjectivity is most desirable in bone metastasis imaging. This review describes the basic imaging modalities of bone metastasis imaging, along with the recent developments and current applications of AI in the respective imaging studies. These concrete examples emphasize the importance of using computer-aided systems in the clinical setting. The review culminates with an examination of the current limitations and prospects of AI in the realm of bone metastasis imaging. To establish the credibility of AI in this domain, further research efforts are required to enhance the reproducibility and attain robust level of empirical support.

Title: Effects of sodium chloride substitutes on physicochemical properties of salted beef.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chuang Li, Jiyong Shi, Chenguang Zhou, Xiaowei Huang, Xiaodong Zhai, Zhikun Yang, Zhihua Li, Xuetao Hu, Yanxiao Li, Jianbo Xiao, Xiaobo Zou
Abstract: In this study, beef was marinated with different low-sodium salt substitutes and heated and aged by employing superheated steam roasting and traditional roasting to investigate the effects of the various substitutes on the physicochemical properties, texture profile, sensory properties, volatile compounds, microstructural characteristics, and safety of cured and aged beef. Twenty kilograms of beef were arbitrarily divided into five treatments and pickled with different low-sodium salt substitutes. The results revealed no significant differences in saltiness, physicochemical characteristics, texture profile, or volatile compounds between the T2 and T3 and T1 (100% NaCl, T1; 75% KCl + 25% NaCl, T2; 50% KCl + 50% NaCl, T3) samples. Furthermore, the T4 and T5 (50% NaCl + 25% KCl + 20% MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 5% CaCl<sub>2</sub>, T4; 100% yeast extract, T5) samples had lower saltiness than the T1 sample. The plasmolysis percentage and osmotic pressure of the T2 and T3 samples were lower than those of the T1 sample. Therefore, reducing sodium by substituting NaCl with 50% KCl or 75% KCl maintained an acceptable sensory and safety profile for beef consumption.

Title: Effects of maltodextrin and protein hydrolysate extracted from lotus seed peel powder on the fat substitution and lipid oxidation of lotus seed paste.
Year: 2023
Authors: Deng Na, Li Zhao, Li Hui, Cai Yongjian, Li Changzhu, Xiao Zhihong, Zhang Bo, Liu Miao, Fang Fang, Wang Jianhui
Abstract: The fat substitution of maltodextrin from lotus seed peel powder (LSP-MD) and the lipid oxidation inhibitory effect of protein hydrolysate (LSP-PH) on lotus seed paste were investigated in this study. The LSP-MD with a dextrose equivalent value of 2.28 showed the smallest specific volume, strongest water-holding capacity and retrogradation. This LSP-MD effectively maintained the sensory quality, hardness and elasticity of low-fat lotus seed paste during storage at 25 °C. For protein hydrolysate, LSP-PH with a hydrolyzation degree of 13.45 % had the strongest DPPH· scavenging capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power, which was further confirmed by FTIR spectra that enzymatic hydrolysis of LSP protein could facilitate the transformation of β-sheet into β-turn. Following 15 days of storage, supplementation with 0.5 % LSP-PH reduced the peroxide value and acid value of lotus seed paste, suggesting its excellent inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation via interacting with hydrophobic polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Title: Comparing the differences of physicochemical properties and volatiles in semi-dry Hakka rice wine and traditional sweet rice wine via HPLC, GC-MS and E-tongue analysis.
Year: 2023
Authors: Zhao Wenhong, Ruan Fengxi, Qian Min, Huang Xiaoyuan, Li Xiangluan, Li Yanxin, Bai Weidong, Dong Hao
Abstract: This study aimed to explore effects of indica rice addition, rice soaking time and rice soup addition on total sugar and alcohol content of semi-dry Hakka rice wine (HRW) and compare its difference in physicochemical properties and volatiles with traditional sweet rice wine (TSRW) via HPLC, GC-MS and E-tongue. The optimal fermentation conditions of semi-dry HRW were 50 % indica rice addition, 12 h rice soaking time and 85 % rice soup addition. The total sugar (16.13 mg/mL) of semi-dry HRW was significantly lower than that of TSRW (135.79 mg/mL), especially the trehalose, glucose, sucrose and maltose. Its alcohol content was significantly higher than that of TSRW. There were significant differences in volatile components between semi-dry HRW and TSRW, especially esters, alcohols and ketones, but no significant differences in organic acids and amino acids. Results obtained could provide reference data for improving the fermentation process and quality of semi-dry HRW.

Title: Microscale tissue engineering of liver lobule models: advancements and applications.
Year: 2023
Authors: Wang Qi, Liu Juan, Yin Wenzhen, Wang Anqi, Zheng Jingjing, Wang Yunfang, Dong Jiahong
Abstract: The liver, as the body's primary organ for maintaining internal balance, is composed of numerous hexagonal liver lobules, each sharing a uniform architectural framework. These liver lobules serve as the basic structural and functional units of the liver, comprised of central veins, hepatic plates, hepatic sinusoids, and minute bile ducts. Meanwhile, within liver lobules, distinct regions of hepatocytes carry out diverse functions. The <i>in vitro</i> construction of liver lobule models, faithfully replicating their structure and function, holds paramount significance for research in liver development and diseases. Presently, two primary technologies for constructing liver lobule models dominate the field: 3D bioprinting and microfluidic techniques. 3D bioprinting enables precise deposition of cells and biomaterials, while microfluidics facilitates targeted transport of cells or other culture materials to specified locations, effectively managing culture media input and output through micro-pump control, enabling dynamic simulations of liver lobules. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the biomaterials, cells, and manufacturing methods employed by recent researchers in constructing liver lobule models.

Title: Toward explainable AI (XAI) for mental health detection based on language behavior.
Year: 2023
Authors: Kerz Elma, Zanwar Sourabh, Qiao Yu, Wiechmann Daniel
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular are paving the new way forward for the automated detection and prediction of mental health disorders among the population. Recent research in this area has prioritized predictive accuracy over model interpretability by relying on deep learning methods. However, prioritizing predictive accuracy over model interpretability can result in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which is critical in sensitive applications such as healthcare. There is thus a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and prediction. The main aim of this work is to address a gap by conducting a systematic investigation of XAI approaches in the realm of automatic detection of mental disorders from language behavior leveraging textual data from social media. In pursuit of this aim, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the balance between accuracy and interpretability across predictive mental health models. More specifically, we build BiLSTM models trained on a comprehensive set of human-interpretable features, encompassing syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, readability, cohesion, stylistics, as well as topics and sentiment/emotions derived from lexicon-based dictionaries to capture multiple dimensions of language production. We conduct extensive feature ablation experiments to determine the most informative feature groups associated with specific mental health conditions. We juxtapose the performance of these models against a "black-box" domain-specific pretrained transformer adapted for mental health applications. To enhance the interpretability of the transformers models, we utilize a multi-task fusion learning framework infusing information from two relevant domains (emotion and personality traits). Moreover, we employ two distinct explanation techniques: the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method and a model-specific self-explaining method (AGRAD). These methods allow us to discern the specific categories of words that the information-infused models rely on when generating predictions. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on two public English benchmark datasets, subsuming five mental health conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and psychological stress).

Title: Is recovery just the beginning? Persistent symptoms and health and performance deterioration in post-COVID-19, non-hospitalized university students-a cross-sectional study.
Year: 2023
Authors: Latifi Ashkan, Flegr Jaroslav
Abstract: Many individuals experience persistent symptoms such as deteriorated physical and mental health, increased fatigue, and reduced cognitive performance months after recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is limited data on the long-term trajectory and prevalence of these symptoms, especially in milder cases. Our study aimed to assess the persistent effects of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, fatigue, and cognitive performance in a cohort of 214 students, averaging 21.8 years of age. Of these, 148 had contracted COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, with the time since infection ranging from 1 to 39 months. We utilized a comprehensive panel of cognitive tests to measure intelligence, memory, and psychomotor skills, and a detailed anamnestic questionnaire to evaluate physical and mental health. While contracting COVID-19 did not significantly impact overall health and performance, it was associated with increased reports of fatigue. However, the reported severity of the disease had a pronounced negative influence on physical health, mental well-being, fatigue, and reaction time. Trends of improvement in physical and mental health, as well as error rate, were observed within the first 2 years post-infection. However, fatigue and reaction time showed a trend of deterioration. Beyond the 2-year mark, physical health and error rate continued to improve, while mental health began to deteriorate. Fatigue and reaction time continued to decline. Overall, our findings suggest that some effects of contracting COVID-19 can persist or even deteriorate over time, even in younger individuals who had mild cases that did not require hospitalization.

Title: Background check: cross-cultural differences in the spatial context of comic scenes.
Year: 2023
Authors: Atilla Fred, Klomberg Bien, Cardoso Bruno, Cohn Neil
Abstract: Cognitive research points towards cultural differences in the way people perceive and express scenes. Whereas people from Western cultures focus more on focal objects, those from East Asia have been shown to focus on the surrounding context. This paper examines whether these cultural differences are expressed in complex multimodal media such as comics. We compared annotated panels across comics from six countries to examine how backgrounds convey contextual information of scenes in explicit or implicit ways. Compared to Western comics from the United States and Spain, East Asian comics from Japan and China expressed the context of scenes more implicitly. In addition, Nigerian comics moderately emulated American comics in background use, while Russian comics emulated Japanese manga, consistent with their visual styles. The six countries grouped together based on whether they employed more explicit strategies such as detailed, depicted backgrounds, or implicit strategies such as leaving the background empty. These cultural differences in background use can be attributed to both cognitive patterns of attention and comics' graphic styles. Altogether, this study provides support for cultural differences in attention manifesting in visual narratives, and elucidates how spatial relationships are depicted in visual narratives across cultures.

Title: Health Recommendation System using Deep Learning-based Collaborative Filtering.
Year: 2023
Authors: Chinnasamy P, Wong Wing-Keung, Raja A Ambeth, Khalaf Osamah Ibrahim, Kiran Ajmeera, Babu J Chinna
Abstract: The crucial aspect of the medical sector is healthcare in today's modern society. To analyze a massive quantity of medical information, a medical system is necessary to gain additional perspectives and facilitate prediction and diagnosis. This device should be intelligent enough to analyze a patient's state of health through social activities, individual health information, and behavior analysis. The Health Recommendation System (HRS) has become an essential mechanism for medical care. In this sense, efficient healthcare networks are critical for medical decision-making processes. The fundamental purpose is to maintain that sensitive information can be shared only at the right moment while guaranteeing the effectiveness of data, authenticity, security, and legal concerns. As some people use social media to recognize their medical problems, healthcare recommendation systems need to generate findings like diagnosis recommendations, medical insurance, medical passageway-based care strategies, and homeopathic remedies associated with a patient's health status. New studies aimed at the use of vast numbers of health information by integrating multidisciplinary data from various sources are addressed, which also decreases the burden and health care costs. This article presents a recommended intelligent HRS using the deep learning system of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-Coevolutionary Neural Network (CNN) that provides insights on how data mining techniques could be used to introduce an efficient and effective health recommendation systems engine and highlights the pharmaceutical industry's ability to translate from either a conventional scenario towards a more personalized. We developed our proposed system using TensorFlow and Python. We evaluate the suggested method's performance using distinct error quantities compared to alternative methods using the health care dataset. Furthermore, the suggested approach's accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure were compared with the current methods.

Title: A decision support system for osteoporosis risk prediction using machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence.
Year: 2023
Authors: Khanna Varada Vivek, Chadaga Krishnaraj, Sampathila Niranjana, Chadaga Rajagopala, Prabhu Srikanth, K S Swathi, Jagdale Aditya S, Bhat Devadas
Abstract: Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone condition that occurs when bone mineral density and mass decrease. This makes the bones weak and brittle. The disorder is often undiagnosed and untreated due to its asymptomatic nature until the manifestation of a fracture. Machine Learning (ML) is extensively used in diverse healthcare domains to analyze precise outcomes, provide timely risk scores, and allocate resources. Hence, we have designed multiple heterogeneous machine-learning frameworks to predict the risk of Osteoporosis. An open-source dataset of 1493 patients containing bone density, blood, and physical tests is utilized. Thirteen distinct feature selection techniques were leveraged to extract the most salient parameters. The best-performing pipeline consisted of a Forward Feature Selection algorithm followed by a custom multi-level ensemble learning-based stack, which achieved an accuracy of 89 %. Deploying a layer of explainable artificial intelligence using tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive Values), LIME (Local Interpretable Model Explainer), ELI5, Qlattice, and feature importance provided interpretability and rationale behind classifier prediction. With this study, we aim to provide the holistic risk prediction of Osteoporosis and concurrently present a system for automated screening to assist physicians in making diagnostic decisions.

Title: Cattaneo-Christov heat flow model at mixed impulse stagnation point past a Riga plate: Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation method.
Year: 2023
Authors: Hussain Saddiqa, Islam Saeed, Nisar Kottakkaran Sooppy, Zahoor Raja Muhammad Asif, Shoaib Muhammad, Abbas Mohamed, Saleel C Ahamed
Abstract: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) via soft computing procedures have attracted the attention of researchers due to their effective modeling, simulation procedures, and detailed analysis. In this article, the designing of intelligence computing through a neural network that is backpropagated with the Levenberg-Marquardt method (<i>N</i>N-BLMM) to study the Cattaneo-Christov heat flow model at the mixed impulse stagnation point (CCHFM-MISP) past a Riga plate is investigated. The original model CCHFM-MISP in terms of PDEs is converted into non-linear ODEs through suitable similarity variables. A data set is generated for all scenarios of CCHFM-MISP through Lobatto IIIA numerical solver by varying Hartman number, velocity ratio parameter, inverse Darcy number, mixed impulse variable, non-dimensional constraint, Eckert number, heat generation variable, Prandtl number, thermal relaxation variable. To find the physical impacts of parameters of interest associated with the presented fluidic system CCHFM-MISP, the approximate solution of <i>N</i>N-BLMM is carried out by performing training (80 %), testing (10 %), and validation (10 %), and then the results are equated with the reference data to ensure the perfection of the proposed model. Through MSE, state transition, error histogram, and regression analysis, the outcomes of <i>N</i>N-BLMM are presented and analyzed. The graphical illustration and numerical outcomes confirm the authentication and effectiveness of the solver. Moreover, mean square errors for validation, training and testing data points along with performance measures lie around 10<sup>-10</sup> and the solution plots generated through deterministic (Lobatto IIIA) approach and stochastic numerical solver are matching up to 10<sup>-6</sup>, which surely validate the solver <i>N</i>N-BLMM.

Abstract: Data on individual tree crowns from remote sensing have the potential to advance forest ecology by providing information about forest composition and structure with a continuous spatial coverage over large spatial extents. Classifying individual trees to their taxonomic species over large regions from remote sensing data is challenging. Methods to classify individual species are often accurate for common species, but perform poorly for less common species and when applied to new sites. We ran a data science competition to help identify effective methods for the task of classification of individual crowns to species identity. The competition included data from three sites to assess each methods' ability to generalize patterns across two sites simultaneously and apply methods to an untrained site. Three different metrics were used to assess and compare model performance. Six teams participated, representing four countries and nine individuals. The highest performing method from a previous competition in 2017 was applied and used as a baseline to understand advancements and changes in successful methods. The best species classification method was based on a two-stage fully connected neural network that significantly outperformed the baseline random forest and gradient boosting ensemble methods. All methods generalized well by showing relatively strong performance on the trained sites (accuracy = 0.46-0.55, macro F1 = 0.09-0.32, cross entropy loss = 2.4-9.2), but generally failed to transfer effectively to the untrained site (accuracy = 0.07-0.32, macro F1 = 0.02-0.18, cross entropy loss = 2.8-16.3). Classification performance was influenced by the number of samples with species labels available for training, with most methods predicting common species at the training sites well (maximum F1 score of 0.86) relative to the uncommon species where none were predicted. Classification errors were most common between species in the same genus and different species that occur in the same habitat. Most methods performed better than the baseline in detecting if a species was not in the training data by predicting an untrained mixed-species class, especially in the untrained site. This work has highlighted that data science competitions can encourage advancement of methods, particularly by bringing in new people from outside the focal discipline, and by providing an open dataset and evaluation criteria from which participants can learn.

Title: Modulation of attention to pain by goal-directed action: a somatosensory evoked potentials approach.
Year: 2023
Authors: Pinto Eleana A, Van Damme Stefaan, Torta Diana M, Meulders Ann
Abstract: Attentional processes are modulated by current goal pursuit. While pursuing salient cognitive goals, individuals prioritize goal-related information and suppress goal-irrelevant ones. This occurs in the context of pain too, where nonpain cognitive goal pursuit was found to have inhibitory effects on pain-related attention. Crucially, how pursuing nonpain motor goals affects pain-related somatosensory attention is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether nonpain motor goal pursuit would attenuate pain-related somatosensory attention.

Title: Multivariable System Prediction Based on TCN-LSTM Networks with Self-Attention Mechanism and LASSO Variable Selection.
Year: 2023
Authors: Shao Yiqin, Tang Jiale, Liu Jun, Han Lixin, Dong Shijian
Abstract: Intelligent prediction of key output variables that are difficult to measure online in complex systems has important research significance. In this paper, by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm to analyze the principal elements of input variables, a temporal convolutional network fused with long short-term memory (TCN-LSTM) network and self-attention mechanism (SAM) is designed to realize dynamic modeling of multivariate feature sequences. For complex processes with multiple input variables, each variable has different effects on the output, so it is necessary to use the LASSO algorithm to perform regression analysis on the input and output data for selecting the principal component variables and reducing the redundancy and computation burden of the network. The TCN network is used to extract the features of the input variables efficiently. The long-term memory performance of time series is enhanced by applying an LSTM network. The multihead SAM is used to optimize the network, and the role of key features is enhanced by assigning weights with probability to further improve the accuracy of sequence prediction. Finally, by comparison with the existing network model, the offline data generated by the high and low converters in the synthetic ammonia industry is used to predict the CO content so as to verify the superiority and applicability of the proposed network model.

Title: A deep insight on psychological aspect in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
Year: 2023
Authors: Patokar Arya, Lohe Vidya, Reche Amit, Sune Ravikant, Datkar Dushyant
Abstract: Studies on Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) have already focused on various medical aspects of this syndrome. This review is focusing on the psychological aspects of Sturge-Weber syndrome patients, the behaviors of patients, and the effects of the disease on the children. This disorder is characterized by angiomas, glaucoma, and seizures with a birthmark. Patients with this syndrome have behavioral problems, a lack of social skills, and a lack of intellectual or academic skills. These patients are usually introverted because of a lack of warmth and limited communication. Friends or classmates tease them by calling them "ugly." All this leads to a lack of social skills, and they mostly keep their feelings to themselves and prefer to be alone. Because of all this mocking by classmates, they keep isolating themselves. All this causes psychological problems in children. They start behaving differently, have suicidal tendencies, and fight with their friends who bully them. Psychological problems are mostly seen in children who are lacking in intelligence and functioning and who have seizure disorders, mostly in those who have frequent seizures. Problems like anxiety, depression, mood changes, anger, and violence are also observed in these patients. All this is always ignored by the parents as well as the doctors. This review aims to focus on the psychological aspect of the patients with SWS, to inform the parents about the behavior of their children with SWS, and to pay more attention to the psychological problems. This review is focusing on the importance of the psychological behavior of patients with SWS, how to diagnose it at an early stage, and how to treat and take care of children with SWS.

Title: Achieving High Accuracy in Predicting the Probability of Periprosthetic Joint Infection From Synovial Fluid in Patients Undergoing Hip or Knee Arthroplasty: The Development and Validation of a Multivariable Machine Learning Algorithm.
Year: 2023
Authors: Paranjape Pearl R, Thai-Paquette Van, Miamidian John L, Parr Jim, Kazin Eyal A, McLaren Alex, Toler Krista, Deirmengian Carl
Abstract: Background and objective The current periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) diagnostic guidelines require clinicians to interpret and integrate multiple criteria into a complex scoring system. Also, PJI classifications are often inconclusive, failing to provide a clinical diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) models could be leveraged to reduce reliance on these complex systems and thereby reduce diagnostic uncertainty. This study aimed to develop an ML algorithm using synovial fluid (SF) test results to establish a PJI probability score. Methods We used a large clinical laboratory's dataset of SF samples, aspirated from patients with hip or knee arthroplasty as part of a PJI evaluation. Patient age and SF biomarkers [white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage (%PMN), red blood cell count, absorbance at 280 nm wavelength, C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-defensin (AD), neutrophil elastase, and microbial antigen (MID) tests] were used for model development. Data preprocessing, principal component analysis, and unsupervised clustering (K-means) revealed four clusters of samples that naturally aggregated based on biomarker results. Analysis of the characteristics of each of these four clusters revealed three clusters (n=13,133) with samples having biomarker results typical of a PJI-negative classification and one cluster (n=4,032) with samples having biomarker results typical of a PJI-positive classification. A decision tree model, trained and tested independently of external diagnostic rules, was then developed to match the classification determined by the unsupervised clustering. The performance of the model was assessed versus a modified 2018 International Consensus Meeting (ICM) criteria, in both the test cohort and an independent unlabeled validation set of 5,601 samples. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method was used to explore feature importance. Results The ML model showed an area under the curve of 0.993, with a sensitivity of 98.8%, specificity of 97.3%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 92.9%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8% in predicting the modified 2018 ICM diagnosis among test set samples. The model maintained its diagnostic accuracy in the validation cohort, yielding 99.1% sensitivity, 97.1% specificity, 91.9% PPV, and 99.9% NPV. The model's inconclusive rate (diagnostic probability between 20-80%) in the validation cohort was only 1.3%, lower than that observed with the modified 2018 ICM PJI classification (7.4%; p<0.001). The SHAP analysis found that AD was the most important feature in the model, exhibiting dominance among >95% of "infected" and "not infected" diagnoses. Other important features were the sum of the MID test panel, %PMN, and SF-CRP. Conclusions Although defined methods and tools for diagnosis of PJI using multiple biomarker criteria are available, they are not consistently applied or widely implemented. There is a need for algorithmic interpretation of these biomarkers to enable consistent interpretation of the results to drive treatment decisions. The new model, using clinical parameters measured from a patient's SF sample, renders a preoperative probability score for PJI which performs well compared to a modified 2018 ICM definition. Taken together with other clinical signs, this model has the potential to increase the accuracy of clinical evaluations and reduce the rate of inconclusive classification, thereby enabling more appropriate and expedited downstream treatment decisions.
